of there being any Holy One in this business right out of your mind . That is probably a nickname for their headquarters : very likely Don Manuel himself , who prides himself on his religion . No , sir ; you 've been warned ( as I see it ) because they think you may be a spy . Anyway without you here they could land stuff on this beach . They have warned several people off the track , up and down the coast , in the last eighteen months . They all had the sense to take the hint . All except one , I think ; one did not . He was a good while ago , before you came here . Prince , his name was , Jacob Galls Prince ; lived on the coast like you , up at San Agostino . ” “ What happened to him ? ” “ He neglected the warning , so then they took steps . The first time he had friends with him who drove them away , but the second time they gave him his pass all right . ” Hilary thought that Mr. Brown 's tone , when he spoke of the giving of the pass , was suddenly savage . He noticed that Mr. Brown 's mouth tightened as he spoke , as though a lid were being snapped down . “ Were the murderers caught ? ” “ No , sir , there 's a lot too much money behind these fellows . ” “ Are you in the United States Police , Mr. Brown ? ” “ No , sir , I 'm just plain Abner Brown , from Brownstead , Massachuzzits . I 'm a minister of Brownstead Light - Arising Church . I 'm in this rum - investigation business , because I hate rum like hell . Yes , Mr. Kingsborough , like hell . Maybe you 'll think that strong talk for a minister of a church that goes dead against any language that 's anyways got a kick . But I guess it 's not too strong . Mr. Kingsborough , I believe that if rum were wiped clean off of this planet this planet would just rise up three hundred per cent . ” “ Where would it rise to , Mr. Brown ? ” “ Rise to the Light , Mr. Kingsborough . ” “ What do you think it would do then , Mr. Brown ? ” “ It would enter into a new plane of being , Mr. Kingsborough , which lies just beyond anything we have going now . I guess the prophets saw it : a new world : gee , I guess it 's worth working to try to bring . All your dividends and worldly cares just dumped where they belong , and all your spiritual being three hundred per cent pure light . ” “ It sounds delightful	Mr. Brown , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es .

she said , while her mother made some remark about poor little Matty 's childishness . Thomas Playle looked up from the lump of boiled fish he was eating . “ It shall be stopped , mistress , ” he said . “ Such flagrant crime is a disgrace to the glorious court of His Gracious Majesty . ” While Francis felt the bundle of letters in his pocket and grinned wickedly to himself . “ You have some men in your pay and arms for them , I suppose , Master Myddleton ? ” observed Playle a little later on in the evening . “ About five , ” said Francis , and then , noting the other 's surprise , he added : “ But some twenty more trustworthy men can be called out at a moment 's notice , if you find it necessary . ” Playle could hardly repress a smile of pleasure ; life seemed suddenly to have opened up to him . Twenty - five men at his orders , a gang of ferocious smugglers to attack , and a pretty girl to stand by and admire at the proper time . His smile broadened . His ambitions flew away with him and he sat staring at his plate , his brown eyes twinkling with pleasure , until Mistress Myddleton had to touch him on the shoulder and give him a candle , before he realized that Betsey , the little maid , waited to show him his room . Once in their room Mistress Eliza and her husband argued over the situation until both were exhausted . “ He 's a handsome man , anyway , ” said the lady at last , as she brushed her little wisp of gray - yellow hair before the oval mirror . “ I wonder if Matilda---- ? ” Francis , who was already tucked in his side of the huge four - poster bed , growled through the curtains , and Mistress Eliza bit her lip . “ He 'll make a difference to the price of tea hereabouts , I 'll warrant , ” she said , after a minute 's silence , as she blew out the candles and opened the casement . Francis grunted . “ Methinks he 'll be a deal of nuisance to the trade , ” he said bitterly . “ No more cheap tabac -- God help us . ” Mistress Eliza echoed his sigh , and they settled themselves to sleep .

Rue de la Charbonnière , Fandor did not at first notice any of the “ boys”—or rather he made a pretence of knowing nobody . In the low - ceiled , smoky room , where seated in state , old Korn , his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows , his bald head shining in the gaslight , was rinsing out glasses stained with the lees of red wine in a basinful of greasy water , Fandor had recognized , with a surprise that bordered on stupefaction , a whole gang of people whom he knew very well . While Paulet was pushing him along towards a little table , where sat an extraordinary - looking individual , head like a broken - down tipstaff surmounted by a well - worn wig , nose decorated with an enormous pair of spectacles , frowsy mutton - chop whiskers framing the face , whom the apache greeted with a “ Good - day , Moche , old cock ! ” Fandor had been taking stock of the other customers . Later on , when Paulet , after ordering a litre of “ Red Seal , ” bread and cheese and Bologna sausage , was describing the late encounter to old Moche and his meeting with the “ new chum , ” Fandor seized the opportunity to scrutinize the group of persons gathered at the further end of the boozing - ken . So , the old gang was come together again ? again the same lot haunted Père Korn 's tavern ? Fandor was dumbfounded to meet once more at the _ Rendez - vous des Aminches _ the very same ill - omened crowd of apaches that had over and over again been mixed up in the crimes and wild adventures of Fantômas ; he could only just contrive to play up to his assumed character and pay decent attention to what Paulet was saying , who meantime was praising him up to the skies to M. Moche . “ Certain sure , ” Paulet was asseverating , “ _ you 'll _ pay for drinks , M. Moche ... yes , yes , your Honour , never say no ! ... But look'ee here , that chap yonder — I do n't so much as know his blessed name — well , there 'd be something to be made out of him , eh ? ... There 's no flies on that bloke , you bet . Why in two twos and a couple of shakes , crack ! he 'd downed his gentleman , let me tell you that , sir . Two constables , sir , and we chucked 'em both in the gutter . Cost me a bit of good rope , it did — but there , I do n't care . ” M. Moche , sipping an extraordinary mixture of brandy and absinthe , applauded Paulet 's narrative , and then turning to Fandor	_ Paulet _ Moche _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Fandor _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
, Tell ole Pharaoh , To let my people go . ” Husky , mournful , melodious voice . Tapping foot . Rolling eye . Silence . “ What kind of a coon song do you call that ? ” inquired the gray derby . “ Why , it 's a Negro melody — they sing them in the South . ” “ Sounds like a church hymn to me . ” He paused . His pale shrewd eyes searched her face . “ You a nigger ? ” The unaccustomed red surged into Magnolia 's cheeks , dyed her forehead , her throat , painfully . “ No , I 'm not a — nigger . ” “ Well , you cer'nly sing like one . Voice and — I do n't know — way you sing . Ai n't that right , Jo ? ” “ Cer'nly is , ” agreed Jo . The young man appeared a trifle embarrassed , which made him look all the younger . Years later , in New York , Kim was to know him as one of the most powerful theatrical producers of his day . And he was to say to Kim , “ Ravenal , h'm ? Why , say , I knew your mother when she was better - looking than you 'll ever be . And smart ! Say , she tried to sell me a coon song turn down in Jopper 's in the old days , long before your time . I thought they were hymns and would n't touch them . Seems they 're hot stuff now . Spirituals , they call them . You hear 'em in every show on Broadway . 'S fact ! Got to go to church to get away from 'em . Well , live and learn 's what I say . ” It was through this shrewd , tough , stage - wise boy that Magnolia had her chance . He did not understand or like her Negro folk songs then , but he did recognize the quality she possessed . And it was due to this precociousness in him that Magnolia , a little more than a year later , was singing American coon songs in the Masonic Roof bill , her name on the programme with those of Cissie Loftus and Marshall Wilder and the Four Cohans . But now she stood up , the scarlet receding from her face , leaving it paler than before . Silently she handed the husky singer his banjo ; tried to murmur a word of thanks ; choked . She put on her hat , adjusted her veil . “ Here , wait a minute , sister . No offense . I 've seen 'em lighter'n you . Your voice sounds like a — ain't that the truth , Jo ? ” Actually distressed , he appealed again to his unloquacious ally in the third row . “ Sure	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — “ — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
master 's study , where he found the Englishman seated at his desk , writing . “ Up already ! ” exclaimed the visitor cheerfully , “ and ready for anything ! Upon my word , my dear fellow , Paris has quite changed your habits . How are you this morning ? ” Ascott turned half round in his chair , extending a careless hand to his visitor : “ Not so bad , and you , Tom Bob ? To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit ? Take a seat , pray ! ” “ Good ! ” thought the detective , “ he is not over and above angry with me ! ” At the same time , remembering that time was flying with alarming swiftness , he announced : “ I have merely come to shake you by the hand , as I was passing your way . ” But Ascott , who appeared to guess the object of his visit , began to hunt through his pocket - book , from which he presently extracted a bank note . Holding this out to the detective : “ Here is my subscription , ” he said : “ will you be so obliging as to hand this thousand francs to the Grand Duchess Alexandra when you have an opportunity of seeing her . ” Tom Bob expressed his willingness with an almost imperceptible smile . “ Just fancy , my dear sir , ” he remarked , “ how timorous Parisian society is ; to think that it is now a perfect mania , a fashionable craze , quite the correct thing in fact , to subscribe to this fund . They want to see Fantômas waxing fat ! ... ' pon my word ! it is excruciatingly funny . Henceforth , I take it the light - fingered gentry will have an easy time of it when they want to make their fortunes . Instead of fagging themselves to commit crimes , they will only have to make it known through the newspapers that they are short of cash for the moment , and the money will come tumbling in straight away ! Why , sir , ” continued the detective , “ it will be the ruin of the police ; I ask you , what are we to do , my colleagues and I , when there are no more any culprits to hunt down , any criminals to arrest ? ” Tom Bob had uttered his little speech in a tone of laughing irony well calculated to divert his host , but the latter declined to be amused . “ What do you think about it ? ” the detective insisted , “ what impression does all this Fantômas business make on you ? ” Ascott , rousing himself from a prolonged reverie , shrugged his shoulders . “ I do n't care a fig about it , ”	” , he remarked , “ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ” , “ ” , “ ” , ” he , “ , ” he , “ , ” he , “ , ” he , “ , ” he , “ , ” he , “ , ” he , “ , ” he , ” he , “ , ” he , “ , ” he , “ ” ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he

And twenty - five 's one thousand twenty - five . And fifty's — and fifty's — twelve twenty - five — gosh a'mighty ! — — A shriek . A bouncing across the gangplank and into the cubby - hole just as Andy was rounding , happily , into thirteen hundred . A hand clutching his shoulder frantically , whirling him bodily out of the creaking swivel chair . Parthy , hat awry , bosom palpitating , eyes starting , mouth working . “ On Canal Street ! ” she wheezed . It was as though the shriek she had intended were choked in her throat by the very force of the feeling behind it , so that it emerged a strangled thing . “ Canal Street ! The two of them . . . with my own eyes . . . driving . . . in a . . . in a — — ” She sank into a chair . There seemed to be no pretense about this . Andy , for once , was alarmed . The tall shambling figure of Frank , the heavy , passed the little ticket window , blocked the low doorway . He stared , open - mouthed , at the almost recumbent Parthy . He was breathing heavily and looked aggrieved . “ She ran away from me , ” he said . “ Sees 'em in the crowd , driving , and tries to run after the carriage on Canal , with everybody thinking she 's gone loony . Then she runs down here to the landing , me after her . Woman her age . What d'yah take me for , anyway ! ” But Parthy did not hear him . He did not exist . Her face was ashen . “ He 's a murderer ! ” she now gasped . Andy 's patience , never too long - suffering , snapped under the strain of the afternoon 's happenings . “ What 's wrong with you , woman ! Have you gone clean crazy ! Who 's a murderer ! Frank ? Who 's he murdered ? For two cents I 'd murder the both of you , come howling in here when a man 's trying to run his business _ like _ a business and not like a yowling insane asylum — — ” Parthy stood up , shaking . Her voice was high and quavering . “ Listen to me , you fool .

but rarely ; caught catfish ; drank river water out of the river itself ; roamed the streets of strange towns alone ; learned to strut and shuffle and buck - and - wing from the Negroes whose black faces dotted the boards of the Southern wharves as thickly as grace notes sprinkle a bar of lively music . And all this despite constant watchfulness , nagging , and admonition from her spinster - like mother ; for Parthy Ann Hawks , matron though she was , still was one of those women who , confined as favourite wife in the harem of a lascivious Turk , would have remained a spinster at heart and in manner . And though she lived on her husband 's show boat season after season , and tried to rule it from pilot house to cook 's galley , she was always an incongruous figure in the gay , careless vagabond life of this band of floating players . The very fact of her presence on the boat was a paradox . Life , for Parthy Ann Hawks , was meant to be made up of crisp white dimity curtains at kitchen windows ; of bi - weekly bread bakings ; of Sunday morning service and Wednesday night prayer meeting ; of small gossip rolled evilly under the tongue . The male biped , to her , was a two - footed animal who tracked up a clean kitchen floor just after it was scoured and smoked a pipe in defiance of decency . Yet here she was — and had been for ten years — leading an existence which would have made that of the Stratford strollers seem orderly and prim by comparison . She had been a Massachusetts school teacher , living with a henpecked fisherman father , and keeping house expertly for him with one hand while she taught school with the other . The villagers held her up as an example of all the feminine virtues , but the young males of the village were to be seen walking home from church with this or that plump twitterer who might be a notoriously bad cook but who had an undeniable way of tying a blue sash about a tempting waist . Parthenia Ann , prayer book clasped in mitted hands , walked sedately home with her father . The vivacious little Andy Hawks , drifting up into Massachusetts one summer , on a visit to fishermen kin , had encountered the father , and , through him , the daughter .

". """""""" At Dale , only a few miles on the other side of the ranges , three mothers were weeping for little ones caught in the flames and burnt to death on their way home from school . No lives had been lost on the southern slope of the hills . All day the men were out riding in the rain , trying to get a better idea of the damage done . They ran up fences , mustered stray cattle , and in the evening brought back pitiful accounts of beasts burned to death in the gullies and dry creek - beds . When they sat with the women round the fire in Steve 's kitchen , their great , green - hide boots steaming before it , breathless stories of fights with the fires were told . Most of the men had been away taking cattle to water when the homesteads were attacked . The flames had leapt the crest of the range and circled the clearings with incredible speed . The women had to do the best they could to save the children , the animals left on the farms , and the buildings , and many a good fight had been waged before they sought safety themselves . It rained steadily for three days ; then the sunshine gleamed and Steve 's house - party broke up . The men , restless and eager to repair the damage that had been done , were off at dawn ; the women and children followed a few hours later , in lumbering carts and carry - alls . Some of them were going to make a lean - to of boughs and bagging , or of oilskins before night , and some were going for stores to the Port , or to the new township that was springing up about the Wirree river . There was bound to be plenty of work for every pair of hands for months to come . While everybody was busy , felling , fencing , splitting , and running up new buildings , it was rumoured that the Schoolmaster and Deirdre were going to leave the hills .

pretty P.D.Q. ” Sard leaped to the rafter , caught it , drew himself up to it , got an arm over it , got his head above the roof and saw the station and the desert , both beautiful with freedom . The train - hand gripped him by the belt and hove upon him . With a wrestle and a struggle he got his other arm over a rafter , then his knees ; he was on the roof top . “ Beat it , Kid , like hell , ” the train - hand said . “ Here 's Twig - Legs . ” Sard just saw that someone was entering the yard from the barton . He did not stay to see who it was , but shot himself off the roof into the waste with one heave . He swerved to his left under cover of the barrack wall and “ beat it ” as his helper had bade . His helper hurled bits of tile into Twig - Legs ' face , then flung himself off the roof and “ beat it ” in the other direction . Sard turned at the angle of the barracks into a sandy street of adobe houses , some of which had white canvas screens spread across their stoops . The street was like a street of the dead in the siesta . A few dogs , the exact colour of the sand , lay in the sun as though killed by a pestilence . Sard dodged their bodies , darted down a lane to the right , and found himself barred by a wall , which was topped by spikes . He got hold of a spike , swung himself up and scrambled over , into a graveyard in which the dead seemed to be coming out of their graves . The rats and dogs snarled at him as he crossed the graveyard , the skulls looked out at him , the hands clutched at him . He went across the graveyard and out of it , by a gap where the wall had fallen , into a lane . He turned to his left , ran along the lane for about fifty yards and turned sharply to his right into a street of detached houses , some of which had palms growing in boxes at their gates . He walked along this street for a little way , listening for pursuers but hearing none . “ I must find out if they 're after that train - hand , ” he said ; “ I must find that train - hand and thank him . ” He listened intently , expecting to hear a tumult at the barracks , but all was still there . He brushed the plaster and tile dust from his clothes .

we might go in more comfort in my car and , going to the garage , drove it out to the road . The Airedale jumped into the seat as I stopped for the chief , and as there was plenty of room , I let him stay . It took us at least fifteen minutes to reach the house before which we stopped . It was a small white place set far back from the street , with a white fence before it . The path we went up was lined with flowers , and roses climbed over the doorway of the house . It was a very pleasant old lady who answered our ringing of the bell — an old lady whose smile turned into an anxious look as she perceived the chief . She led us into an old - fashioned parlor of the sort I had not seen for years . The haircloth furniture was of a beautiful design , and the old prints upon the wall took me back to my boyhood days in New England . Motioning us to a chair , she seated herself , with a very anxious look upon her face . Then , without waiting for the chief to tell his errand , she asked in a trembling voice : “ I hope you have not heard anything bad about Florence ? ” The chief shook his head . “ No , Mrs. West , ” he replied . “ I do n't know anything bad about her . But I wanted to ask you some questions . You see we do n't know where Florence is , and so far I ca n't find any one who does . Now , did she come to your house yesterday afternoon ? ” The woman was rocking back and forth in her chair . When she answered , I could tell she was worried . “ No , ” came the reply . “ I have not seen her for several days . You know when she got that position with Mr. Warren , she had to stay at his house . She said he often had her work at night , and it was too far to come back here . She did run in every day or so , but I have not seen her for at least three days . And then — ” she paused as if shocked by what she was going to add , then said : “ And then I heard about her saying that Mr. Warren ought to be killed . ” The face of the old lady was flushed , but the expression was more one of perplexity than anything else . Her eyes did not leave the chief 's face . “ You know , of course , that , though Florence was a very impulsive girl , she was a good girl , ” she added proudly .

the idler who had accosted him ( and who was still mysteriously lolling at the waterside ) shut his eyes and then opened them quickly as though to dispel a vision . “ Gripes , Ravenal ! Robbed a bank ? ” From the tip of his shining shoes to the top of his pale gray hat , Ravenal was sartorial perfection , nothing less . The boots were hand - made , slim , aristocratic . The cloth of his clothes was patently out of England , and tailored for no casual purchaser , but for Ravenal 's figure alone . The trousers tapered elegantly to the instep . The collar was moulded expertly so that it hugged the neck . The linen was of the finest and whitest , and cunning needlecraft had gone into the embroidering of the austere monogram that almost escaped showing in one corner of the handkerchief that peeped above his left breast pocket . The malacca stick seemed to take on a new lustre and richness now that it found itself once more in fitting company . With the earnings of his first two weeks on the _ Cotton Blossom _ enclosed as evidence of good faith , and future payment assured , Gaylord Ravenal had sent by mail from the Louisiana bayous to Plumbridge , the only English tailor in New Orleans , the order which had resulted in his present splendour . He now paused a moment to relieve himself of that which had long annoyed him in the beady - eyed one . “ Listen to me , Flat Foot . The _ Cotton Blossom _ dropped anchor at seven o'clock this morning at the New Orleans dock . I came ashore at nine . It is now three . I am free to stay on shore or not , as I like , until nine to - morrow morning . Until then , if I hear any more of your offensive conversation , I shall have to punish you . ” Flat Foot , thus objurgated , stared at Ravenal with an expression in which amazement and admiration fought for supremacy . “ By God , Ravenal , with any luck at all , that gall of yours ought to get you a million some day . ” “ I would n't be bothered with any sum so vulgar . ” From an inside pocket he drew a perfecto , long , dark , sappy . “ Have a smoke . ” He drew out another . “ And give this to Vallon when you go back to report . Tell him I wanted him to know the flavour of a decent cigar for once in his life . ” As he crossed the gangplank he encountered Mrs. Hawks and Frank , the lumbering heavy , evidently shore - bound together . He stepped aside with a courtliness that the Ravenals of Tennessee could not have excelled in the	” Gripes paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused , he paused .
"facts of science and technology which his habit of omniverous reading has been continually storing within his brain . As result of this unusual combination his tireless energies have been directed , since childhood in Luxembourg , to writing popular science in a fashion peculiarly attractive to young men and boys who , like himself , possess a keen interest in all realms of physical Nature . His first essay in this field was his monthly magazine , _ Modern Electrics _ , the first to attempt to outline in language understandable by American youth the newly developing science of _ wireless communication _ . He made of this first venture into the publishing business a medium wherein , amid serious newsy articles regarding current electrical developments , his eager imagination could find full play . The most outstanding , most extraordinary prophecies which this young clairvoyant had at that time conceived -- all based on his keen observations and appreciation of their real significance and trend -- he chose to record in the guise of a fanciful romance bearing the strange , cabalistic title of this book . The author , even at that early date ( 1911 ) had a clear conception of future television , then quite unheard of , almost undreamed of . He dubs it """""""" Telephot """""""" and outlines its revolutionary utilities . His hero , Ralph , explains to his enamorata how man has mastered weather - control . Only today has a professor shown New York City how to end its water famine by man - made torrential rains . Years in advance of their advent he describes libraries of microfilm projected on large screens ; and news printed electrolytically , without printer 's ink . Today we begin to read of this as being partially commercialized . His """""""" Menograph , """""""" or thought recorder , is today crudely realized in our lie - detector .

you acquainted with its contents . ” “ Read , read ! ” rose a unanimous cry — and in a voice trembling with emotion , M. Monnier read out : “ — By my decree , Désiré Ferrand has been held prisoner since yesterday . Again by my decree , he will be released to - day at 5 o'clock . “ By seizing the Minister of Justice and holding him at my disposition , I have merely desired to afford an indication of my power to compel the House to negotiate with me ; I want money , I must have a million francs ; let the Government decide to give me this sum , and I will disappear . If not , the direst consequences must be faced ; I shall begin with the Minister of Justice , the entire Government will be dealt with in turn . ” * * * * * The reading of this monstrous document roused in the auditors divers feelings of the most opposite nature . While some members laughed uproariously , persuaded it was simply a grotesque joke , others looked perturbed , asking themselves if the President of the Council had not lost his head . But a vivid curiosity was universal . There could be no doubt something prodigious , phenomenal was involved ! Supposing the defiance to be facetious , still the disappearance of the Minister was alarming . What was this mysterious power that functioned thus in the dark , but whose existence could not be disputed ? Instinctively , reason , logic , common sense urged one and all to seek to know the author of these atrocious pleasantries , and M. Monnier was exhorted to make known the name signed at the foot of the letter . With a wave of the hand the President demanded silence , then he announced , in troubled tones , not knowing whether his words would provoke an outburst of mockery or of panic : “ It is signed , ” he said , “ Fantômas ! ” The Chamber was in an uproar . The name was too familiar , too notorious , too terrifying , not to sow distraction in the ranks of the people 's representatives . In truth all were pretty well agreed that only Fantômas could have had the audacity to imagine such a scheme could succeed . “ Fantômas ! ” they declared , “ yes , Fantômas is at the bottom of all this , that is certain , beyond dispute ! ” But numerous objections were raised against any such conclusion : “ Fantômas , why yes , he exists , that can not be denied ; but the police unearthed the fellow , the elusive brigand was none other than the Criminal Investigation Officer , Inspector Juve !

. ” * * * * * “ Madam , I will use no empty words of compliment to thank you for granting me this interview . Words are incapable of translating my feelings , and between us they would be yet more vain than with others . ” The “ Fantômas ” who uttered the words bowed low with infinite respect before the Grand Duchess Alexandra , whom he had just come upon in one of the little nooks of greenery , so quiet and retired , so convenient for flirtations or confidential talks , which the great lady had contrived in the superb winter garden , opening out of her drawing rooms . The masquer went on : “ I will not thank you , madam , for on us , alas ! weighs a past too heavy to allow soft words to do aught but call up sad memories in our hearts . That past you do not disown any more than I do , but I ask your permission to remember in speaking to you two facts , that you , you , the Grand Duchess Alexandra , are Lady Beltham , and that I , under this travesty of Fantômas , am Jérôme Fandor . ” In a weak , trembling voice , Lady Beltham questioned : “ Speak , sir ! But first , why this disguise ? why , why do you , you of all men , wear that cowl ? ” “ Because , that mask , madam , ” returned Fandor , in a broken voice , “ that mask lets me remain nameless among your guests . Probably you forget , Lady Beltham , that at this present moment Jérôme Fandor is held by general consent to be a criminal . And , besides this , madam , yet another reason — you will forgive my naming it — led me to adopt this disguise . Was I not certain you would accord a few minutes ' talk to the man wearing this costume . I could not tell if it would be possible for me to give you the letter ; but I felt convinced if as Fantômas I asked to speak with you , you would not refuse your lover three minutes ' conversation . ” Lady Beltham , pale and trembling , made no reply — what answer could the unhappy lady find to give Fandor , the man who at that very time was suffering the direst torments at the hands of the real Fantômas , her lover ? She could only repeat again : “ Speak , sir , what do you want of me ? ” “ A small thing , madam , ” returned Fandor , “ a small thing , and yet of infinite moment—_happiness _ . I am going to beg you to say three words — three words that will assure me the chiefest joy of my life .	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
asked the first question . “ You told us this morning that Mr. Warren worked every afternoon in his library . Did his secretary work with him ? ” The woman nodded and then said : “ Yes . ” The coroner went on : “ What time did she return to the house yesterday afternoon ? ” I saw a strange look flit across the woman 's face and she replied : “ Around four o'clock . ” “ Was that her usual time to return ? ” “ No , sir . As a rule she worked until five and often until seven . ” “ And did she give any reason for her return at this early hour ? ” The woman 's face flushed a little and then she said : “ No , sir . That is , she did not say why she was back so early , but I was surprised to see her — more so because of what she did . ” There came a silence in the room and the low whispers that one could hear after each statement died away . The coroner , who seemed to know just what the woman would testify , asked : “ You say , ‘ What she did . ' What do you mean ? ” The housekeeper had been speaking in a low voice without any apparent show of emotion . Now she raised her head , and her voice was quick and impulsive as she replied : “ I was in the living room when the secretary returned . She rushed in the front door and ran upstairs . She lived at the house . I thought that she had gone to her room for something . I thought nothing of this until a few moments later she came downstairs ; in her hand was her suit case . ” “ Her suit case ? ” “ Yes . And she seemed very excited . Her face was flushed and when I spoke to her she was very angry . ” “ What did you say to her ? ” “ Why , naturally , I asked her where she was going . Seeing the suit case and knowing that it was not time for Mr. Warren to stop work , I wondered what had happened . ” She paused , and as she did not continue , the coroner asked : “ Well , what did she say ? ” The woman was silent a moment then replied : “ She banged the suit case down on the floor and said , ‘ I am going away . You can tell Mr. Warren I wo n't do any more work for him . ' ” Again she hesitated , as if holding something back . Once more the coroner had to request her to finish her statement .

, watched me while I drank . His eyes were very curious , yet he was too well bred to ask me what had happened . Placing the glass on the near - by table , I told him briefly of what had taken place . My visit to the swamp I passed over lightly , but did tell of seeing a man run through Carter 's hedge , and how I had followed him . As I told of the sudden attack upon the roof of his tower , and how I was thrown over the side , he gave a gesture of horror . “ Heavens , man ! ” he said , “ some one tried to kill you . ” I agreed to this , and there fell a silence . He broke it to say that there was nothing unusual in the door of the tower being open . In fact it was never locked , the village people using it for a place from which to give their visitors a view of the lake . But to hear that which had happened to me should have taken place upon his property shocked him . His dark eyes never left my face as he expressed again and again his horror . I could see that from his point of view the whole thing was unexplainable . He told me he had been reading , and he pointed out where he had thrown his book when he heard the sound of my pounding on the roof . He half laughed as he said that for a moment he was a very astonished man . He could hear some kind of a banging overhead , and at last went up the steps to the attic . There he was startled to discover that the sound came from the roof . When he heard my voice , he thought for a moment the boys of the village were playing some sort of a prank . The clock suddenly striking eleven roused me to the lateness of the hour . With a little exclamation of pain at the stiffness of my muscles I rose to my feet saying that I had better be going . He went with me to the door , then out upon the lawn . There we both turned and looked at the tower , which loomed above our heads . Saying “ good night , ” I went rather slowly across the grass , through the opening in the hedge , and over Carter 's lawn . The large living room was a blaze of light , and I went up the steps and into the house . Carter and Ranville were sitting in two large chairs talking very earnestly . It was the Englishman who saw me first , and I half laughed as I saw his eyes sweep over my disheveled figure and his jaw drop .

that has stood beside you laughing in silence at your words , dear Hugo . ” The scientist stared at his friend . De Medici had risen . His face was flushed and his eyes were gleaming . “ The thing unravels itself in my head , ” he continued , his voice grown tense . “ Yes , dear Hugo , a melodrama . Crude , preposterous , but easily proved . And simple . ” “ You mean that you doubt her guilt ? ” Dr. Lytton snapped . “ That I know who killed Ballau , ” De Medici answered . “ Yes , not Florence . And not your good friend Julien . And not the phantoms either . But someone else . ” “ And you know ? ” De Medici nodded . His brows were contracted . When he spoke again it was in a meditative tone . “ The commonplace , Hugo , ” he said softly , “ how easily one overlooks it . Little questions that a child might ask . For instance , what an awful lot of work it must have been for a single woman to take care of ten rooms alone . One ca n't help but feel a curious admiration for the diligence and energy of Jane , the housekeeper . Wait a minute ! ” He pointed his finger commandingly at the scientist . “ Sit still . I want to show you a little drama I have written while you talked . ” De Medici moved swiftly to the telephone . “ Park View 0146 , ” he spoke into the mouthpiece . Dr. Lytton glared at him . “ Mad , ” whispered the scientist . De Medici smiled . “ Hello ! ” he exclaimed suddenly into the telephone . “ Who is this ? ” A pause and he continued : “ Jane , this is Mr. De Medici calling . Miss Ballau is very ill at my apartment . We have the doctor here . She is dying . She told me to telephone you at once . She says she must see you , that you must come over at once . ” De Medici listened . No sound came from the other end of the wire . And then a scream drifted out of the receiver . “ Do you understand ? ” he shouted . “ Come over at once . ” He waited a few moments for a sound . But the receiver remained silent against his ear . “ She 's gone , ” he murmured . He hung up and turned to the doctor . “ I am at the present moment unable to decide , Hugo , which of you is entitled to the credit of being the world 's greatest blundering idiot , you or Lieutenant Norton .

The cows lifted their heads , bellowing protestingly ; their breath steamed before them in the chill air . The horses and dogs , heeling and wheeling them , and the trampling hoofs of the herd , beat a wraith - like mist from the cold , and still sleeping earth . Davey was to steer by the stars till he came to a point on the road that would give him a clear and easy descent to the sale yards on the outskirts of Melbourne . It was too late in the year to try the usual route . He was to take a winding track on the edge of the swamp that lay between the southern hills and Port Phillip . Only the blacks knew the paths through the brown - feathered reeds and dense ti - tree scrubs . Conal had tried to cross it once in the summer and got bogged there , losing a score of fine beasts . If Conal could not find his way across it , the Schoolmaster did not think that Davey could . It was only in case of untoward happenings that he advised trusting to the black boy 's knowledge of the tracks through the swamp , and taking to the cover of the moss - dark , almost impenetrable , scrub that covered it . Davey had given his word to the Schoolmaster that if he met Conal he would give the cattle over to him and return to the hills .

? ” “ There , sir , to port , talking to a priest . ” “ Wait one minute , Mr. Harker , he may have some news for us . Ho , Mr. Brentano , were you waiting here to intercept me ? ” Mr. Brentano left the priest and came running up to Captain Cary , who had now dismounted from the caleche . Mr. Brentano was a middle - aged , foxy - looking man with an astute mind . “ Ah , Captain Cary , ” he said , “ the boatmen told me that you had not gone aboard . I hoped to catch you here as you went off . By the way , here is some mail for the _ Pathfinder _ . There is this priest , a Father Garsinton , from the mining district , who came in , just as the office closed , to beg a passage to Santa Barbara . ” “ Indeed . ” “ He has a letter from one of our clients , one of our most important clients . ” “ Do I understand that he wants to come in the _ Pathfinder _ ? ” “ Well ; he comes from one of our very best clients , Captain Cary , so if you could manage to strain a point . . . . He is a priest , used to every kind of hardship ; you could put him in the coal - hole , anywhere , it would make no difference to him , he would give no trouble . I do n't suppose he 's very rich , but of course he would pay his passage . You see , Captain Cary , it is a very special case . He is a poor man . He has only a month 's leave of absence . He wants to reach Santa Barbara to settle the affairs of his mother , who has died there . He has missed the _ Alvarado _ . He is an Englishman and his poor sister is in Santa Barbara all alone . ” Captain Cary bit his glove , and showed a poor mouth . “ I suppose we 'll have to take him , ” he growled to Sard ; “ I hate priests : they always take snuff . But I 'll have no nonsense about fish on Fridays . ” Mr. Brentano led up and introduced Father Garsinton . Sard noticed the priest particularly . He was a big bull of a man , with immense chest and shoulders , a short , thick neck , a compact , forceful head and little glittering eyes . There was something magnificent in his bearing . He was of about the middle age , near that time in life when muscle goes to flesh , but still on the sinewy side of it .

across the floor . Silently we followed him , and when we reached the desk , we received another surprise . It was a very large desk , with a great deal of room underneath . By its side stood a wastebasket , but the wastebasket was filled to overflowing with small pieces of paper — paper torn into hundreds of small pieces , which spilled over the side of the basket and over the floor — typewritten sheets torn into hundreds of tiny bits . Bartley picked up a handful of paper and tried to fit some of the pieces together . He found this rather difficult , and then stood looking thoughtfully at the basket . I took several pieces of the paper in my hands and discovered that they once had been part of some typewritten manuscript . Ranville gave one look at the basket , glimpsed the typewritten letters , then glanced hurriedly at the desk . “ It looks as though some one went to considerable effort to destroy a manuscript . ” Patton 's voice came sharp and quick . “ They did ; I found that mess of papers on the floor . When I left the room there lay on my desk several hundred pages of Warren 's notes . And now — now they are torn to a thousand pieces . And”—he paused—“for the life of me I can not understand it . ” Patton 's face , as he looked at the destroyed manuscript , showed that he was facing a situation which was beyond him . Not only was he very much disturbed , but also rather frightened at what had taken place . It was with a great deal of eagerness that he started to answer the request Bartley made — to tell us just what had happened . “ Carter brought me over , you know . I was unable to do very much until the girl , who had acted as Mr. Warren 's secretary , came . She came to the library about one and showed me what had been done . I found that Warren had half completed his book . In fact I never looked at any of his material beyond where he had ended . He was half finished , and I thought it would be best to see just what had been done . ” Bartley gave a quick look at the pieces of paper upon the floor and asked : “ Then this torn paper is simply the notes and materials which Warren used in the first portion of his book ? ” “ Yes . I left the papers upon the desk when I went out . As I told you , I did not go beyond what Warren had already done . I wanted to become familiar with his plan .

This Santa Barbara is great , great ; there is no place like it on earth : only I want men : I have brains , plenty , but only two hands . I want hands like yours . Will you join me ? Choose your work , what say you , and be with me . What would you like ? ” “ I 'd like to congratulate you , sir . ” “ What for ? My fortune ? ” “ No , sir , your gratitude . ” He was pleased with the answer . “ Ha , yes , ” he said , “ the ingratitude of a king . But it is often hard to be grateful to individuals : it is easier to be grateful to the world . “ I see you are not married , Harker . You , too , have sorrowed . “ But it is now early . I have to rise early to a special Mass at our friends of Santa Alba yonder . I shall have but a short watch below . Come , then , Harker mio , to coffee with me at seven , at the palacio ; you will have thought , then , what we may do together . So , then , I shall expect you . ” He took Sard 's hands and shook them ; then he stood back , as though stepping away from the life that he enjoyed into the loneliness of monarchy . Majesty seemed to come upon him like a garment ; for the purple , like other habits , may be assumed . His guards clicked , saluted , and fell in . They were all men from Encarnacion , from the old Encinitas estate , where they showed as relics a hoof of Alvarado 's horse , set in silver , the sword of Vasco Nuñez , and a piece of the script of the Gospel of St. John . They passed down the marble stairs , uttering the cries which Sard had heard as they came up . “ They cheer the dead , Señor , ” the waiter explained , “ they cheer the Heroic Five and Señora Jennings and the Pobrecita , whose images they pass . ” The bells chimed for one in the morning : all shops and cafés in the Plaza closed . The waiters came from within , dressed in their old coats , with turned - up collars ; their feet passed away , some to the old town , some to the north , till the town was almost silent . A cat or two went stealthily or swiftly across the Plaza .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Peter was always needed for this ; his special knowledge made him indispensable , and he became practically the boss of the proceedings . It had been arranged thru “ Shorty ” Gunton and the other “ under cover ” men that the meetings of the Communist and Communist Labor parties should be held on the same night ; and all over the country this same thing was done , and next morning the world was electrified by the news that all these meetings had been raided at the same hour , and thousands of Reds placed under arrest . In American City the Federal government had hired a suite of about a dozen rooms adjoining the offices of Guffey , and all night and next morning batches of prisoners were brought in , until there were about four hundred in all . They were crowded into these rooms with barely space to sit down ; of course there was an awful uproar , moaning and screaming of people who had been battered , and a smell that beat the monkey cage at the zoological gardens . The prisoners were kept penned up in this place for several weeks , and all the time more were being brought in ; there were so many that the women had to be stored in the toilets . Many of the prisoners fell ill , or pretended to fall ill , and several of them went insane , or pretended to go insane , and several of them died , or pretended to die . And of course the parlor Reds and sympathizers were busy outside making a terrible fuss about it . They had no more papers , and could not hold any more meetings , and when they tried to circulate literature the post - office authorities tied them up ; but still somehow they managed to get publicity , and Peter 's “ under cover ” men would report to him who was doing this work , and Peter would arrange to have more raids and more batches of prisoners brought in . In one of the “ bomb - plots ” which had been unveiled in the East they had discovered some pink paper , used either for printing leaflets , or for wrapping explosives , one could not be sure . Anyhow , the secret agencies with which Guffey was connected had distributed samples of this paper over the country , and any time the police wanted to finish some poor devil , they would find this deadly “ pink paper ” in his possession , and the newspapers would brand him as one of the group of conspirators who were sending infernal machines thru the mails . Section 82 Peter was so busy these days that he missed several nights ' sleep , and hardly even stopped to eat .

As you stood in the lobby between the acts , smoking your cigarette , you said , “ She 's giving a fine performance . ” “ A fine performance ! ” Magnolia echoed one evening , rather irritably , after she and Kim had returned from the opening of a play in which one of Kim 's friends was featured . “ But she does n't act .

altars with seven veils before them , and thru these the Chief Magistrian would appear , clad in a long cream - colored robe with gold and purple borders , and with pink embroidered slippers and symbolic head - dress . His lectures and religious rites had been attended by hundreds -- many of them rich society women , who came rolling up to the temple in their limousines . Also there had been a school , where children had been initiated into the mystic rites of the cult . The prophet would take these children into his private apartments , and there were awful rumors -- which had ended in the raiding of the temple by the police , and the flight of the prophet , and likewise of the majordomo , and of Peter Gudge , his scullion and confederate . Also , Peter thought it was fun to tell Gerald Leslie about his adventures with the Holy Rollers , into whose church he had drifted during his search for a job . Peter had taken up with this sect , and learned the art of “ talking in tongues , ” and how to fall over the back of your chair in convulsions of celestial glory . Peter had gained the confidence of the Rev. Gamaliel Lunk , and had been secretly employed by him to carry on a propaganda among the congregation to obtain a raise in salary for the underpaid convulsionist . But certain things which Peter had learned had caused him to go over to the faction of Shoemaker Smithers , who was trying to persuade the congregation that he could roll harder and faster than the Rev. Gamaliel . Peter had only held this latter job a few days before he had been fired for stealing the fried doughnut . Section 10 All these things and more Peter told ; thinking that he was safe now , under the protection of authority . But after he had spent about two months in the hospital , he was summoned one day into the office , and there stood Guffey , glowering at him in a black fury . “ You damned fool ! ” were Guffey 's first words . Peter 's knees went weak and his teeth began to chatter again . “ Wh - wh - what ? ” he cried . “ Did n't I tell you to hold your mouth ? ” And Guffey looked as if he were going to twist Peter 's wrist again . “ Mr. Guffey , I ai n't told a soul ! I ai n't said one word about the Goober case , not one word ! ” Peter rushed on , pouring out protests . But Guffey cut him short . “ Shut up , you nut !

Anny shook her head . “ Nay , I could not tell him -- I love him so , ” she said . “ I got up and ran away to bed , leaving him there , his head on the seat I had left , and , oh , Nan ! all night long I dreamed I could still hear him breathing heavily like that and calling ‘ Anny , Anny , Anny .

Anny shrugged again . “ Nay , not in words , ” she said carelessly , “ but he said , ‘ Go back to the Ship and I will come , ' so you see nothing will change . ” The elder woman seized the girl by the shoulders . “ You 're mad , Anny , ” she said fiercely . “ Do n't you see he 'll take you away ?

it is against me the public launches its accusations . Yes , the game is up , my fate is sealed ; no stone will be left unturned to hunt me down and arrest me . ” Fandor 's reflections might have lasted longer yet perhaps , he might perhaps have thought out a plan of escape , for he felt convinced the bloodhounds of the Prefecture of Police would find little difficulty in tracking him down to Père Moche 's , if he had not of a sudden had the impression of footsteps , stealthy footsteps , at his side . Springing instantly to his feet , the young man challenged : “ Who goes there ? ” but there was no answer , the garret was absolutely silent . “ Yet surely I was not dreaming ? ” he muttered . Holding his breath , motionless as a statue , the journalist waited with ears astrain . But no , he must have been mistaken ; there was not a thing to attract his attention . “ I 'm getting nervous , ” he muttered ; “ true , I 've good reason to be just now . ” He made a tour of inspection , but found nothing that seemed suspicious . This done , he returned and knelt down again in front of _ La Capitale _ , where the paper lay open on the floor . He was on the point of resuming reading when he had the same unaccountable impression again . This time it was certain , definite , unmistakable . He had felt a current of air pass like a breath over his face . It was no hallucination , for the journal he was reading had half lifted from the ground , the unshaded flame of the lamp had flickered . Once more he started up , again he made the tour of his cockloft . “ Nothing there ! ” he muttered , “ nothing at all ! ” But as he was returning slowly , hesitatingly , to the middle of the room , with pursed lips and frowning brow , suddenly , with a sharp pop , his lamp went out , while whirling before a powerful draught , _ La Capitale _ fluttered across the floor . It was stupefying ! Instinctively , in the pale moonlight , Fandor stepped across the garret , meaning to set his back against the wall , in case of further eventualities . But he had not taken three steps before a choking cry escaped him . Thrown with horrid violence , a lasso had wound itself about his throat ! He was dragged to the ground , his limbs paralysed , half strangled , half dead ! Then , with horror unspeakable , he looked and saw ... The window of the attic , a dormer window , had been opened noiselessly .

In less than a minute the dog 's body was full of fresh warm blood and immediately efforts were made to bring the dog back to life .

At the same time one of the assistants had trained a vacuum tube on the dog 's head and its cathode shot the powerful F-9 - Rays into the animal 's brain . No sooner had these rays , which are among the most powerful brain stimulants , been trained on the dog than he began to show weak signs of life .

Electricity and certain chemicals increase the ratio of growth , a fact that has been known for many centuries . It is , however , the scientific application of this knowledge that makes it possible to raise five crops a year . The European farms use only the heat of the sun to stimulate plant growth , but during the night , when the temperature drops , growth is practically nil . """""""" Notice that the top and sides of our hothouses have two walls . In other words , one hothouse is built within another . The air locked between the two hothouses is an excellent heat insulator and even though the sun is low at 4 o'clock , the temperature is practically unchanged in the hothouse , at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening . Even in the winter , when the sun sets about 4 o'clock and it is cold , we are able to store up enough heat during the day to keep a high temperature as late as 7 and 8 o'clock .

He saw a great many “ bulls ” whom he knew scattered thru the audience , and also he saw the Chief of Police and the head of the city 's detective bureau . When Herbert Ashton was half way thru his tirade , the Chief strode up to the platform and ordered him under arrest , and a score of policemen put themselves between the prisoner and the howling audience . Altogether they arrested seven people ; and next morning , when they saw how much enthusiasm their action had awakened in the newspapers , they decided to go farther yet . A dozen of Guffey 's men , with another dozen from the District Attorney 's office , raided the office of Ashton 's paper , the “ Clarion , ” kicked the editorial staff downstairs or threw them out of the windows , and proceeded to smash the typewriters and the printing presses , and to carry off the subscription lists and burn a ton or two of “ literature ” in the back yard . Also they raided the headquarters of the “ Bolshevik local , ” and placed the seven members of the executive committee under arrest , and the judge fixed the bail of each of them at twenty - five thousand dollars , and every day for a week or two the American City “ Times ” would send a man around to Guffey 's office , and Guffey would furnish him with a mass of material which Peter had prepared , showing that the Socialist program was one of terrorism and murder . Almost every day now Peter rendered some such service to his country . He discovered where the I. W. W. had hidden a printing press with which they were getting out circulars and leaflets , and this place was raided , and the press confiscated , and half a dozen more agitators thrown into jail . These men declared a hunger strike , and tried to starve themselves to death as a protest against the beatings they got ; and then some hysterical women met in the home of Ada Ruth , and drew up a circular of protest , and Peter kept track of the mailing of this circular , and all the copies were confiscated in the post - office , and so one more conspiracy was foiled .

which was fresh - coloured , looked wholesome , hearty and healthy ; but at a second glance Sard felt that there was something wanting . There was a greyish puffiness under the eyes , and something unnatural , or at least unusual , about the eyes themselves . The man 's face was unusual , the man was unusual , he was an odd - looking man , with enormous bodily strength to make his oddness felt . Sard , who had not seen any such Englishman before , realised that a man so odd would choose a way of life followed by few Englishmen . Father Garsinton wore new blacks ; he was smart , for a priest from a mining camp ; his cloth smelt new ; his voice , as he thanked Captain Cary , was soft and gracious , but his eye was sidelong as he spoke , taking stock of Sard . “ Mr. Harker , ” Captain Cary said , “ will you be away , then to make those enquiries , and then follow us on board ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ If you should hear of those people , do n't let them entangle you into delaying . There 's a norther coming and I can not wait for you . I would not like you to lose your passage . ” “ I 'll not lose my passage , sir . ” “ I see the tug 's down the quay there , with steam up . Now , Mr. Garsinton , have you any gear to go aboard ? ” “ Yes , Captain Cary , a small trunk and that packing - case . ” “ That packing - case ? That sort of deckhouse by the bollard ? It looks like a pantechnicon van . What is in it ? ” “ Two sets of Las Palomas crockery for my sister , with the necessary packing . ” “ You 'll have to pay me freight on it . It will take a yard - tackle to get it over the side . Now we must get a boatman and a couple of Carib boys to get it aboard for us . ” Sard in his caleche was by this time turning about to go to the hotel . He paid particular attention to the packing - case , which shone there in new white wood beside the bollard . He thought that it looked big for two sets of crockery , but supposed that the stuff was dunnaged against the sea . He drove to the hotel . At the hotel , the woman in charge remembered the name of Kingsborough . “ Yes , ” she said , “ a lady and her brother , rather more than three weeks ago ; they were here for two nights , on the first floor , in Rooms B and D. Let me	” Sard smelt a smoky smell , a smoky smell , a smoky smell , a smoky smell , a smoky smell , a smoky smell .
"along the seaboard became the main stock route between Port Southern and Rane , a newly - founded settlement at the further eastern end of the coast , a township of curious mushroom growth , cropped up about the Wirree Ford and McNab 's shanty . It was a collection of huts , wattle and dab , whitewashed , for the most part ; but some of them were of sun - baked sods , plastered together , or of the stones which were scattered over the plains or filled the creek beds . McNab 's weatherboard shanty , with its sign - board of a black bull , with red - rimmed eyes on a white ground , was by far the most pretentious . The history of these dwellers about McNab 's was a matter of suspicion . They arrived from nowhere , out of the night , silently , and it was surmised , crept up the river in the cockle - shell boats which had brought them over the Straits and were sunk in the slowly - moving river when they had served their purpose . The fertile flats , stretching to the edge of the mountains , had been taken up before McNab got his holding on an arm of the Wirree . He set about acquiring the selvedge of the plains which was cut off from the finer , more arable land by a scrubby line of densely growing ti - tree . Most of the Wirree Ford men ran cattle on these strips of coarse - grassed land , thrashed by the sea breezes . But they were no sticklers for the niceties of boundaries and property laws . They drove their first , wild - eyed , scraggy herds whither they listed , a cursing , blasphemous crew , none dared gainsay them . It was reckoned better to have the good - will than the enmity of the Wirree river men . The body of a settler who had threatened """""""" to have the law of them """""""" for grazing their beasts on his land was , a few days afterwards , found in the river , drifting with the tide out to sea . Some of the Wirree men made a living as fishermen . Others maintained themselves by a desultory farming . They ploughed the grey land of the seaboard with wooden hand - ploughs . But many of them thrived on what they could make out of the stockmen and drovers who passed through the township on their way to Rane or to the Port . McNab was powerful enough even in those days , and many and ingenious were the stories he invented to account for the presence of men who came to the Wirree Ford unexpectedly . As the settlement grew , it did justice to the rumoured accounts of its origin . McNab 's was the meeting place of stockmen , drovers and teamsters on"	Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree , Wirree McNab , McNab , e , McNab , McNab , McNab , McNab , McNab , McNab , McNab , McNab , Wirree .

But he must be careful and evasive wherever possible . A. “ It was twenty minutes after ten . ” Q. “ Did you see Miss Ballau ? ” A. “ No , she had just left . ” Q. “ Did you ask any questions of anyone ? ” Ah , they had Cort up their sleeve . They would produce him next and confound him with the man 's testimony . De Medici 's eyes glanced slowly around the room as if in quest of a memory . Cort was not to be seen . A. “ I do n't remember to whom I spoke . I recall asking someone where Miss Ballau was and they told me she had left . ” Q. “ Did you think it strange that Miss Ballau should leave the theater in the middle of the show ? ” Ah , now they were closing in . His eyes rested intently upon the reddish face of Lieutenant Norton . The man was watching him , as he had watched him that night in the apartment . A. “ Yes , I thought it odd . But I knew Miss Ballau was under mental stress . ” Q. “ What sort of mental stress ? ” A. “ She had been distracted in the morning when we rode in a cab together and I asked her to marry me . She had told me about her father . She was worried over him and she had complained of a headache . ” Simple lies , establishing nothing . De Medici glanced at his hands . Would they ask him about the blood on his fingers ? Q. “ Do you think that Mr. Ballau committed suicide , from what you saw that night ? ” A. “ No . ” Q. “ Then it is your opinion that Mr. Ballau was murdered ? ” A. “ Yes . ” De Medici waited while the coroner made notes with a pencil . Curious that he should make notes at that moment . And why had they asked him for his opinion ? They had asked none of the others . Norton again . Yes , it was Norton . The coroner with his pompous words and heavy manner was a blind . It was the reddish - faced man beside him who was operating the web ... spinning it out carefully and invisibly .

, and is about to be tried a third time , and our District - Attorney is quoted as saying that he will be tried half a dozen times if necessary . At the last trial there were produced a total of twenty - five witnesses against Flowers , and out of these nineteen were either Peter Gudges and McGivneys , or else police detectives , or else employees of the local political machine . A deputy United States attorney , talking to me about the case , told me that he had refused to prosecute it because he realized that the “ Paul letter , ” upon which the arrest had been based , was a frame - up , and that he was quite sure he knew who had written it . He also told me that there had been formed in Los Angeles a secret committee of fifty of the most active rich men of the town ; that he could not find out what they were doing , but they came to his offices and demanded the secret records of the government ; and that when he refused to prosecute Flowers they had influence enough to have the governor of California telegraph to Washington in protest . Questioned on the witness stand , I repeated these statements , and the deputy United States attorney was called to the stand and attributed them to my “ literary imagination . ” In the old Russian and Austrian empires the technique of trapping agitators was well developed , and the use of spies and “ under cover ” men for the purpose of luring the Reds into crime was completely worked out . We have no English equivalent for the phrase “ agent provocateur , ” but in the last four years we have put thousands of them at work in America . In the case against Flowers three witnesses were produced who had been active among the I. W. Ws . , trying to incite crime , and were being paid to give testimony for the state . One of these men admitted that he had himself burned some forty barns , and was now receiving three hundred dollars a month and expenses . At the trial of William Bross Lloyd in Chicago , charged with membership in the Communist party , a similar witness was produced . Santeri Nourteva , of , the Soviet Bureau in New York , has charged that Louis C. Fraina , editor of the “ Revolutionary Age , ” was a government agent , and Fraina wrote into the platform of the Communist party the planks which were used in prosecuting and deporting its members . On December 27 , 1919 , the chief of the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice in Washington sent to the head of his local bureau in Boston a telegram containing the following sentences : “ You should arrange with your under cover informants	” , he said , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” , ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ”
was once more raised in a flaunting tone . “ Let it be enough , ” he continued , “ to say that it hath some ninety lives to answer for . ” There was a general gasp at this information and a slow smile spread over Black'erchief Dick 's face as he noted their amazement . “ It will be wonderful old I reckon ? ” Joe Pullen put the question quietly , but as though he expected an answer in the affirmative . “ Nay , ” the Spaniard smiled again , “ ‘ twas of my own killings I was talking , ” he said . “ Oh ! ” Joe Pullen leant back and closed his eyes as though bored with the conversation . This procedure seemed to irritate the Spaniard , for he said suddenly , “ Look , friend , ' tis a fair weapon , ” and he threw the glittering thing at the man in the high - backed seat with a seemingly careless jerk of the wrist . The dagger shot through the air , a streak of glistening steel , and fastened itself in the wood half an inch above Joe 's head . Sue shrieked , but there was a murmur of admiration at the feat from the men looking on . Lazily Joe Pullen sat up and wrenched the blade out of the soft wood ; he studied the dagger carefully . “ Ah ! ” he said at last , an expression of polite interest on his face , “ a wonderful fine throw that , sir , ” and then added , the knife poised delicately between a clumsy thumb and forefinger , “ I wonder now could I do that ? ” He raised his hand and appeared to be taking aim directly at the Spaniard 's head . “ _ And was losht in the rolling sea _ , ” murmured Gilbot , his head fell forward on his chest and his pot , slipping off his knee , fell clattering on the stones . The noise woke him , and he looked up just in time to see Pullen , knife in hand , standing in the middle of the room . “ Eh ? eh ? ” the old man 's voice had the remnant of a note of authority in it . “ Put down t ' knife , lad . Ai n't no good in knives . ” His head fell forward on his chest again . “ Why not shing happy shong ? ” he mumbled . Joe grinned . “ Ah , ” he said slowly , “ maybe the old'n 's right . ” He handed the knife to the Spaniard who took it without a word . “ I might have hit you -- I ai n't a very good hand wi ' knives , ” he said pleasantly . The Spaniard smiled graciously . “	, ” he mumbled , “ ah , ” he said , “ ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ai , ” he smiled , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” ” he shook his hand , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he , “ ” ” he shook his hand , “ ” and he sat down , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ n'tis , ” he said , “ n'tis , ” he said .
. As Sard looked at it , he felt an oppression in the air , as though all the life had gone out of it . “ Here 's the norther , ” he said ; “ and as it is coming on so slowly , it is going to be bad . ” Sard propped his bicycle against the gates and hammered on the lodge - door with his knife - handle . Nobody answered . The door , which stood slightly ajar , let out a smell of stale tortilla . Sard could see little pale ants wandering on the floor within . He hammered again and again and called . Presently a slatternly - young negress , in a blue cotton gown patched with sacking , came up among the pine trees , and grinned at Sard like an idiot . “ O Jesu , ” she said , “ O Jesu ! ” “ Can I go to the house ? Is anybody there ? ” “ The gates are always locked . ” “ Yes , but I want to go to the house . ” “ Tehee . ” “ May I go to the house , to see Mr. Kingsborough ? ” “ O Jesu . ” “ I am going to the house . See that no one steals this bicycle , or you 'll be a sick negress , mucha , mucha . ” He crossed the fence by the gap ( the fence was indeed mainly gap ) and set off down the weed - blinded drive under pines which had been tapped and were now either dead or dying . The effect was dismal in that muggy air , but Sard 's heart beat high with the expectation of adventure . Beyond all doubt , this was the house of his dream , the dreams were true , and he was going to meet her the very thought of whom made all that inner life of which no one had any suspicion . The turn in the drive brought him within sight of the house . He stood still , at the turning , to take stock of it . Then he went boldly up the steps and rang the bell . An old white - haired negro , with charming manners , admitted and announced him . In a moment he returned , to say that Mr. Kingsborough would see him , at once , if he would follow . Sard followed , along the hall , which was paved , for the coolness , and grass - matted for ease in walking . The hall was bare of furniture save for an old Spanish chest , painted with the life of St. Dominic , which stood under a window , with its legs in glass jars ( against the ants ) . Like all men accustomed to take bearings , Sard fixed the details of it .	” he shook his head , “ oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ ” , ” he said , “ ” , “ ” , ” he said , “ ” , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , ” he said , “ ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , “ ” he , ” he , he ,

"mine and Dorothy 's from my early newspaper days : a place on East 53rd Street , where you can get a good meal if you have the money to pay for it and the time to wait for it -- and I had both . I knew that none of Winnie 's friends would be seen dead in the place and I did n't want to try lunch at the Harvard Club , where I 'd have to sign the dining - room order or the bar - check . The place was reasonably uncrowded -- it was not quite noon -- and I had a pleasant lunch . It was a little after one o'clock when I reached the Harvard Club .

The Pacific news was good . The fighting on Okinawa was going our way and the clean - up in the Philippines was well in hand . The Navy Department discounted enemy reports of heavy damage to American warships by Jap suicide - pilots but , as an old Navy P.R.O. , I could tell that it had been plenty . I 'd heard about the Kamikazes from some of our pilots who had seen them off Leyte and I had no doubt that they were doing a job on the 7th Fleet .

M. Moche might have been taken for a perfectly honest man ; yet his old - maidish manner , his soft , silky address , his often exaggerated politeness , his trick of rubbing his hands and bending his back before visitors , somehow modified any such favourable impression . Still , as a matter of fact , despite his unpleasing exterior , M. Moche had earned an excellent reputation in the _ quartier _ . He was a serviceable , obliging old fellow , occasionally over inquisitive about other folks ' business , but as a rule ready enough to do a kindness . Many a one in the neighbourhood had had recourse to him at one time or another for little loans of money , granted , it is fair to say , at quite reasonable rates of interest , and none had come to any harm at the hands of the old man of business . The truth is , M. Moche was richer than people might suppose , judging by the appearance of his abode on the fourth floor , a quite modest set of apartments . Apart from the outer room with the barred and windowed partition , the accommodation included a second apartment , a trifle larger , a trifle more pretentious , which was honoured with the title of drawing room . One or two armchairs of worn and faded leather and a round table with a gas chandelier over it made up the furniture . The room had two windows looking on the street , and affording a superb view over the northern parts of the city and the fortifications running parallel with the Boulevard Mortier . The third room of the flat was M. Moche 's bedroom , a chamber rarely occupied , however , for its tenant frequently slept from home , and appeared to utilize his quarters in the Rue Saint - Fargeau merely as a place for interviewing callers and conducting his business affairs in general . M. Moche , in fact , was entitled to use more than one address , and it was matter of common knowledge that he was owner of a house in the La Chapelle district . ... The collector had finished his verification of the total , and declared it to be correct . Then he added , as he turned to take leave of M. Moche : “ There , my day 's work 's done , or as good as done ; I 've only another flight to climb in your house , and then back to the bank as fast as I can go , for I 'm behind my time already . ” At the words , M. Moche looked at the man with an air of surprise . “ You have a payment to collect on the floor above , ” he asked , “ and from whom , pray ? ” Bernard consulted a little memorandum	M. Fargeau , M.

he told Nell that he loved her , that he would never be able to love anybody else , and that he had made piles of money now , he was high up on the ladder of prosperity . Nell did not laugh at him , as she had laughed in the Temple of Jimjambo , for it was easily to be seen that Peter Gudge was no longer a scullion , but a man of the world with a fascinating air of mystery . Nell wanted to know forthwith what was he doing ; he answered that he could not tell , it was a secret of the most desperate import ; he was under oath . These were the days of German spies and bomb - plots , when kings and kaisers and emperors and tsars were pouring treasures into America for all kinds of melodramatic purposes ; also the days of government contracts and secret deals , when in the lobbies and private meeting - places of hotels like the de Soto there were fortunes made and unmade every hour . So it was easy for Nell to believe in a real secret , and being a woman , she put all her faculties upon the job of guessing it . She did not again ask Peter to tell her ; but she let him talk , and tactfully guided the conversation , and before long she knew that Peter was intimate with a great many of the most desperate Reds , and likewise that he knew all about the insides of the Goober case , and about the great men of American City who had put up a million dollars for the purpose of hanging Goober , and about the various ways in which this money had been spent and wires had been pulled to secure a conviction . Nell put two and two together , and before long she figured out that the total was four ; she suddenly confronted Peter with this total , and Peter was dumb with consternation , and broke down and confessed everything , and told Nell all about his schemes and his achievements and his adventures -- omitting only little Jennie and the grass widow . He told about the sums he had been making and was expecting to make ; he told about Lackman , and showed Nell the newspaper with pictures of the young millionaire and his school . “ What a handsome fellow ! ” said Nell . “ It 's a shame ! ” “ How do you mean ? ” asked Peter , a little puzzled . Could it be that Nell had any sympathy for these Reds ? “ I mean , ” she answered , “ that he 'd have been worth more to you than all the rest put together . ” Nell was a woman , and her mind ran to the practical aspect of things . “ Look here	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

, I 'll be bound , ” ventured Parthy , shrewdly , “ rubbing up the brass and the cuspidors . ” ) He had met a man who ran a rag - front carnival company . He could use them for one attraction called The Old Plantation ; or , The South Before the War . They were booked through the Middle West . In a few weeks , if Elly was stronger . . . He said nothing about money . He said nothing of their possible return to the _ Cotton Blossom _ . That , Andy knew , was because of Elly . Unknown to Parthy , he sent Schultzy two hundred dollars . Schultzy never returned to the rivers . It was , after all , oddly enough , Elly who , many many years later , completed the circle which brought her again to the show boat . Together , Andy , Parthy , and Doc went into consultation . They must keep Ravenal . But Ravenal obviously was not of the stuff of show - boat actors . He had made it plain , when first he came aboard , that he was the most impermanent of troupers ; that his connection with the _ Cotton Blossom _ would continue , at the latest , only until Schultzy 's return . He meant to leave them , not at New Orleans , as they had at first feared , but at Natchez , on the up trip . “ Do n't tell him Schultzy ai n't coming back , ” Doc offered , brilliantly . “ Have to know it some time , ” was Andy 's obvious reply . “ Person'd think , ” said Parthy , “ he was the only juvenile lead left in the world . Matter of fact , I ca n't see where he 's such great shakes of an actor . Rolls those eyes of his a good deal , and talks deep - voiced , but he 's got hands white 's a woman 's and fusses with his nails .

public understand that it was necessary , you had to carry on what was called “ propaganda , ” to keep the public aware of the odiousness of these cattle , and the desperate nature of their purposes . The man who perceived that most clearly was the Attorney - General of the country , and Guffey in his lecture pointed out the double nature of his activities . Not merely was the Attorney - General breaking up the Communist and the Communist Labor parties and sending their members to jail ; he was using the funds of his office to send out an endless stream of propaganda , to keep the country frightened about these Red plots . Right now he had men in American City working over the data which Guffey had collected , and every week or two he would make a speech somewhere , or would issue a statement to the newspapers , telling of new bomb plots and new conspiracies to overthrow the government . And how clever he was about it ! He would get the pictures of the very worst - looking of the Reds , pictures taken after they had been kept in jail for weeks without a shave , and with the third degree to spoil their tempers ; and these pictures would be spread on a sheet with the caption : “ MEN LIKE THESE WOULD RULE YOU . ” This would be sent to ten thousand country newspapers all over the nation , and ninety - nine hundred would publish it , and ninety - nine million Americans would want to murder the Reds next morning . So successful had this plan proven that the Attorney - General was expecting to be nominated for President by means of it , and all the agencies of his department were working to that end . The same thing was being done by all the other agencies of big business all over the country . The “ Improve America League ” of American City was publishing full - page advertisements in the “ Times , ” and the “ Home and Fireside Association ” of Eldorado was doing the same thing in the Eldorado “ Times , ” and the “ Patriot 's Defense Legion ” was doing the same thing in the Flagland “ Banner . ” They were investigating the records of all political candidates , and if any of them showed the faintest tinge of pink , Guffey 's office would set to work to rake up their records and get up scandals on them , and the business men would contribute a big campaign fund , and these candidates would be snowed under at the polls . That was the kind of work they were doing , and all Guffey 's operatives must bear in mind the importance of it , and must never take any step that would hamper this political campaign , this propaganda on behalf	” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” 
Fandor ; I argued that Fantômas , wishing to murder me , would do it as swiftly as possible ; consequently , if I wished to escape his criminal manœuvres , it was advisable to lay a trap for him . The trap consisted in engaging a room here . Fantômas knew of this . How , I can not say , but Fantômas knows everything . For my part , _ I _ knew — knowledge is power — I knew that , on my coming to the Terminus , an attempt was going to be made on my life . What sort of an attempt ? I felt uncertain . I suspected the lift — that risk avoided , in revenge I was pretty well convinced , when I entered this room , the room I had engaged in advance , that something was going to happen here . But what ? I thought of a poisonous gas infiltrated during the night , and that is why I questioned the waiter about the occupant of the room above . Monsieur Fandor , I told you you had no nose , did I not ? The fact is I am astonished that you did n't , like me , detect in the room a faint smell of burning , of burning tinder . ” Fandor , lost in admiration at the precision of the American detective 's discoveries , the nature of which he was beginning to fathom , declared : “ I noticed the smell of burning perfectly well , but ... ” “ But you drew no inference from it . _ I _ inferred that a slow - match was burning — but where ? To search for it was running a risk , an incautious movement might precipitate the crisis . Instead , I said to myself , Monsieur Fandor — the natural thing for a traveller to do when he enters a bedroom is to sit down . Therefore it is more than probable , if a shot is to be fired , from a revolver say , or from a gun , that the weapon will be levelled at the height of a person 's head seated on a chair . I cut down my chair so as to be below the line of fire ! I made you sit on the floor to save you from being hit ! ” One thing , and one thing only , could Fandor find to say to express his admiration adequately : “ Juve could not have done better ! ” “ Truly , it was not so bad . Now , if you would like to get to the bottom of things , we will take a look on top of that wardrobe ... There , what did I say ? ” From the top of the wardrobe Tom Bob , mounted on a chair , proceeded to unship a sort of gatling -	Fandor sah es so , er sah es so , er sah es so , er sah es so , er sah es so , er sah es so , er sah es so , er sah es so , er sah es so , er sa , a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
hysterical . His stumble crashed in that stillness like a shot . Sard squeezed his arm to steady him : then they both listened : then Hilary whispered : “ I hear a sort of scratching noise . ” Sard heard it too , and thought , at first , that it was the fidgeting of feet , then made sure that it was not that , nor yet the brushing of leaves upon a window , but some noise which he could not yet explain : it might be nothing but the breeze upon a ventilator . It was a constant flutter somewhere to their left ; it came no nearer . “ It 's all right , ” Hilary muttered . “ Seconds out of the ring , ” Sard answered . “ Come on , now . Time . ” He could see almost nothing . He groped about the hall . It was soft to the feet with a closely - woven grass matting . He moved eight paces to his right and touched a wall or screen of wood : “ wood panelling , ” he decided . It ran from the front of the house into the house : it seemed to be the boundary wall of the hall on that side . He groped along it to the end , but found no door , nor any break in the panelling . A table stood near this wall ; it bore a metal tray containing a visiting card nearly as big as a postcard . Sard took the card and listened . He heard Hilary at a little distance breathing like a roaring horse . Sard wished that he would make less noise with his breathing . He crept across to him and told him so . “ You 're snorting like a horse yourself , ” Hilary said . “ Have you found any door ? ” “ No . There 's no door on this side . Only a row of pegs for hats and a rack for whips , but the whips are gone . ” “ Is it all panelling ? ” “ Yes , panelling ; with two chairs . ” “ The door will be at the back then , ” Sard said . “ Come to this wall at the back . What is that thing on the wall ? ” “ It looks like a painting , ” Hilary said . “ It is a painting , ” Sard said , “ but the paint is running on it . And it does n't smell like paint . ” “ Is there no door ? ” “ None . None that I can see , ” Sard whispered . “ Let me see , ” Hilary answered . He peered close to the wall and groped along it with his fingers . There seemed to be no door there .

as “ free love . ” So he paid , hand over fist ; he not only paid all the expenses of the unregistered honeymoon , he bought numerous expensive presents at the lady 's tactful suggestion . She was always so vivacious and affectionate when Peter had given her a present ! Peter lived in a kind of dream , his money seemed to go out of his pockets without his having to touch it . Meantime great events were rolling by , unheeded by Peter and his grass widow who never read the newspapers . For one thing Jim Goober was convicted and sentenced to die on the gallows , and Jim Goober 's associate , Biddle , was found guilty , and sentenced to prison for life . Also , America entered the war , and a wave of patriotic excitement swept like a prairie fire over the country . Peter could not help hearing about this ; his attention was attracted to one aspect of the matter -- Congress was about to pass a conscription act . And Peter was within the age limit ; Peter would almost certainly be drafted into the army ! No terror that he had ever felt in his life was equal to this terror . He had tried to forget the horrible pictures of battle and slaughter , of machine - guns and hand - grenades and torpedoes and poison gas , with which little Jennie had filled his imagination ; but now these imaginings came crowding back upon him , now for the first time they concerned him . From that time on his honeymoon was spoiled . Peter and his grass widow were like a party of picnickers who are far away in the wilderness , and see a black thunder - storm come rolling up the sky ! Also , Peter 's bank account was running low . Peter had had no conception how much money you could spend on a grass widow who is a “ swell dresser ” and understands what is “ proper . ” He was overwhelmed with embarrassment ; he put off telling Mrs. James until the last moment -- in fact , until he was n't quite sure whether he had enough money in bank to meet the last check he had given to the landlady . Then , realizing that the game was up , he told . He was surprised to see how charmingly a grass widow of “ good breeding ” could take bad tidings . Evidently it was n't the first time that Mrs. James had been to the beach . She smiled cheerfully , and said that it was the jury - box for her once more . She gave Peter her card , and told him she would be glad to have him call upon her again -- when he had restored his fortunes . She packed up her suit - case and her new	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the tower . With a sudden burst of strength I managed to free myself from one of the clutching hands and half turned . But the effort was in vain . Again the arms closed around me , and as I slipped on the stone floor , I felt myself being raised and the iron rail pressing against my back . I tried to regain my feet — tried to throw off the clutching hands , but could not ; and then , as if my weight was of no avail , the man lifted me slowly but surely until my feet were off the floor . Then he gave a sudden push , and with a cry I went off the platform . Chapter VII The Chief and I — Make a Call It is said that a person drowning has all the events of his life pass before him . I do not know if that is true or not ; but in the brief second in which I was falling through space I had but one thought — how foolish I had been to have ever climbed those tower stairs . The thought must have come and gone in a mere flash of time , but it seemed long enough for me to reflect over . Then , with a crash and a jar which seemed to shake every bone in my body , I struck the roof . Struck the roof and started to roll down its side . Luckily , there was not a very steep pitch to the roof , and I managed to stop my slide just as I reached the eaves . Aching in every part of my body , I pulled myself into a sitting position and gave a cautious look around . Above me was the tower , and I thanked my stars that the height was only about six feet . If I had fallen several feet from where I did , I would not have stopped until I reached the ground . And there is no doubt I would have been killed . As it was , it seemed a miracle that I had not broken any bones . For though I was pretty sore from the fall , I decided there was nothing else the matter . But my position was far from enviable . I was sitting on the very edge of the roof between the church and the rectory , about thirty feet from the ground . The pitch of the roof was not so steep but what I could climb it , but that would do me no particular good . Above me was the roof of the house , and I remembered that I had seen a light in the rectory as I came across the lawn . There must be some sort of an arrangement to reach the roof through the rectory attic . I decided to try and find it .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
” Almost on the defensive , in a voice of fear , Lady Beltham said for the third time : “ Speak , sir , speak ! ” “ Madam , ” Fandor resumed in trembling accents , “ I love deeply , with all my heart and all my soul , an unhappy young girl whose name you know , for it bears a melancholy renown . Elisabeth Dollon , I mean . Madam , by your lover 's doing — nay , never protest , all denial is in vain between us — by your lover 's doing , I , I Jérôme Fandor , am deemed by Elisabeth Dollon , as by all men , to be Fantômas . She would love me if she knew me innocent , now she hates me , fears me , flies from me ! Madam , I have always been to you , and even to him who is dear to you , an honourable foe , the dreadful penalty I suffer to - day as the result of the war I wage is the more cruel as it is undeserved . What hurt can it do you , Lady Beltham , what hurt can it do Fantômas , even should I enjoy a little happiness , should I win Elisabeth 's love ? ... This is the prayer I would make to you ; she is single - hearted , she is enthusiastic , she sacrifices my life to you ; madam , I pray you , I beseech you , go to Elisabeth and tell her I am not Fantômas , and that she can love me ! ” Such profound feeling inspired Jérôme Fandor 's words , his voice vibrated with such deep emotion , as he spoke , that Lady Beltham herself could not help being greatly moved . Yes , Jérôme Fandor was surely right , he had always been an honourable enemy . Surely he was right again in describing his position with Elisabeth as horrible . Surely again , what harm could it do Fantômas for him to enjoy a little happiness ? Lady Beltham was touched , won over ; she burst out suddenly : “ I know you are Jérôme Fandor , sir ; I know it , and I need only know that ! I decline to understand the allusions you have made .

"my command , though confining myself strictly to the truth , how beautifully we did those things in the World Above . I had ( yes , I confess it ) flattered myself that I would thus be instrumental in bringing about a great reform , in righting a cruel injustice . Vain vision , vain alluring dream ! As I went on with my panegyric , I saw wonder and amazement gathering in the beautiful eyes of Lathendra Lepraylya . When I had finished , she sat for some moments like one dumfounded .

had ever known . McGivney remarked that she had been playing with Peter even then -- she had been in Guffey 's pay at that time , collecting evidence to put Pashtian el Kalandra in jail and break up the cult of Eleutherinian Exoticism . She had done many such jobs for the secret service of the Traction Trust , while Peter was still traveling around with Pericles Priam selling patent medicine . Nell had been used by Guffey to seduce a prominent labor leader in American City ; she had got him caught in a hotel room with her , and thus had broken the back of the biggest labor strike ever known in the city 's history . Peter felt suddenly that he had a good defense . Of course a woman like that had been too much for him ! It was Guffey 's own fault if he hired people like that and turned them loose ! It suddenly dawned on Peter -- Nell must have found out that he , Peter , was going to meet young Lackman in the Hotel de Soto , and she must have gone there deliberately to ensnare him . When McGivney admitted that that was possibly true , Peter felt that he had a case , and proceeded to urge it with eloquence . He had been a fool , of course , every kind of fool there was , and he had n't a word to say for himself ; but he had learned his lesson and learned it thoroughly . No more women for him , and no more high life , and if Mr. Guffey would give him another chance-- Guffey , of course , snorted at him . He would n't have a pudding - head like Peter Gudge within ten miles of his office ! But Peter only pleaded the more abjectly . He really did know the Reds thoroughly , and where could Mr. Guffey find anybody that knew them as well ? The Reds all trusted him ; he was a real martyr -- look at the plasters all over him now ! And he had just added another Red laurel to his brow -- he had been to see Mrs. Godd , and had had the seat of his trousers kicked by Mr. Godd , and of course he could tell that story , and maybe he could catch some Reds in a conspiracy against Mr. Godd . Anyhow , they had that perfectly good case against McCormick and the rest of the I. W. Ws . And now that things had gone so far , surely they could n't back down on that case ! All that was necessary was to explain matters to Mr. Ackerman-- Peter realized that this was an unfortunate remark . Guffey was on his feet again , pacing up and down the room , calling Peter the names of all the barnyard animals , and incidentally	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
laughed . “ She shall marry thee -- and by a priest you bring -- ha -- ha ! ” Blueneck had never seen his captain blush before and he now regarded the little Spaniard with great interest . The usually sallow skin was stained with a vermilion as he turned on the woman in anger . “ Keep to your promise then and be silent , ” he said softly , “ or by Heaven I 'll blow your pig - sty of a rat - ridden hulk off the Island . ” The woman looked at him , frightened for a moment , but soon she began to laugh . “ She shall we d thee , my pretty , fine gentleman , she shall we d thee -- I'll see to that , ” she said , scrambling to her feet--“and the rum shall be paid , you promise , master ? ” Dick nodded . “ I swear it , ” he said . Then he got up and beckoned to Blueneck to follow him . “ Good - morrow , mistress , ” he said , taking off his hat . Pet stood looking after them . “ I 'll coax her , ” the woman called . “ I 'll coax her , ” and all the way as they went down the beach they could hear her cracked , horrible laughter . CHAPTER XVIII “ Rum ! rum ! ru - u - m - m ! ” Nan Swayle sat in her miserable little cabin with her knees drawn up to her chin ; her cat was perched on a rum keg beside her and there was no light save for the cold gleam of stars coming in from the open door . She sat there , a tall , gaunt figure steadily rocking herself to and fro as though keeping time to some monotonous rhyme . She was talking to herself in a deep , weary voice , and the words she uttered were always the same , “ Rum -- rum -- ru - u - m - m ! ” Outside on the marshes everything was very quiet , and she rocked on , undisturbed for a while . Then from the direction of the Stroud she heard the squeak of a frightened gull as it flew up , disturbed from its rest , and then another a little nearer , and again nearer still . The woman did not cease her rocking ; she knew someone was coming over the dykes to see her , but what mattered that ? Suddenly she stopped , however , leaned her head forward to listen , and then sprang from her chair with surprising agility and hurried to the door . “ Nan -- Nan , where are you ? ” called a girlish voice out of the darkness . “ Stay where ye are , Anny lass , till I	” Then he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair , he , he , he , he , he sat down on the chair , and he sat down on the chair , he sat down on the chair .
volcanic rock at 125 fathoms . Then the wind dropped and it came on very thick . We had all hands on deck waiting for a call and from time to time we heard the padre , sometimes fighting with this thing in his throat , sometimes calling out the burial service . It went on like that , sir , for some hours . Sometimes we had a few stray slants of air and then they would die away again . At about 3.30 we heard breakers on the port bow and then breakers on the starboard beam . Mr. Dorney said we must be among the Chamuceras . Anyway , we were embayed . I do n't think Mr. Dorney had been off his feet for two days and two nights , sir . We drew clear of these breakers , and it was just beginning to grow light when we heard breakers again on our starboard bow and then breakers on the port bow and then the wind died on us , sir , and there was n't a breath . Suddenly the padre appeared on deck in red socks and with a red tamash for a loin - cloth . He stood at the poop rail , laughing and cussing , and then the fog cleared away , and old Holdfast , the Vancouver man , who was in the cross - trees , sang out , ‘ Land , ho , ' and the look - out man shouted , ‘ Breakers dead ahead , sir . ' “ Mr. Dorney sang out to let go both anchors , and one of them , at least , was let go . Somebody sang out , ‘ Weather main brace , ' I suppose , to lay the main yards aback . Most of us ran to the weather main braces , and I was on the rope and we were just beginning to haul , when I saw something white rise up on our own weather bow , and then she went crash on to something and knocked us all off our feet . She got up just as we did and seemed to look around and wonder what was happening , and she lifted clear of whatever it was and seemed to jump out of it , but perhaps it was only the broken water that gave me the idea that she did , for then she ran fairly on to it with a crash which tore the boat 's skids clean off and pitched her fore and main top - gallant masts right out of her like bitten - off carrots . ” “ Were the men aloft killed , ” Sard asked . “ No , sir , they were warned by her hitting the first time . After that second crash she did n't strike again , she only worked down into where there were great breakers all round us .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
handed to its new owner . He heard Mr. Jones explaining : “ Yes , there 's another . A mate to this , but it 's not on sale . ” So she had asked for the other one , too . The one which formed part of the mysterious evidence in the hands of the police . His meditations ended as the creature pushed past him . She had apparently lost all further interest in the auction . She had bought the mate to the candlestick that had stood at Victor Ballau 's head the night he was murdered ... and was leaving . “ This is what I was expecting , ” De Medici murmured inwardly , “ something like this . ” He was following her carefully into the hall and out of the apartment . She paid no attention to him as they entered the elevator together . With her package clutched under her arm , she walked off limpingly down the street , a heavily dressed , bent old woman leaning on a cane , her witch face peering obliviously ahead of her . De Medici , smiling , sauntered in her wake . “ We must forget everything , ” he mused , “ Florence , Rollo , Maine , midnight visitors and everything , and pay attention . Here 's a clew . It may be a coincidence . A candlestick fanatic . But the Ballau auction would be out of her way . Park Avenue is a foreign settlement to her . She came there for a purpose . She showed interest in nothing until the candlestick was offered . Yes , she came to buy one thing — the pair of candlesticks . ” The slow chase turned out of the main thoroughfares . The old woman seemed in no hurry . She zigzagged from one street into another . Despite her age her bent body seemed tireless . For an hour she continued moving , ignoring street cars and vehicles . A labyrinth of decrepit little streets confronted De Medici . Pawn - shops , dirty - looking stores , restaurants and movie theaters .... “ As I thought , ” De Medici mused , “ Park Avenue is a foreign settlement to her . ” He paused a short distance from the old woman . She had come to a halt in front of a decrepit house . The blousy street was alive with noisy , dirty - faced children , fat women and foreign - looking men . The old woman peered about her for a moment and then moved toward the evil - looking shack . De Medici watched her body disappear slowly down a flight of basement steps and hurried forward . As he arrived , she entered the lower part of the house through an ugly - looking door . He could hear her lame step thumping in the distance from the foul -	De Medici , a fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fanatic fan .
up the coast to the Recalde reef to take some dredgings . After a few days at the reef , she sailed for Santa Barbara , where she arrived at noon just nineteen days from Sard 's going ashore at Las Palomas . Sir James stood at his side as he brought the _ Yuba _ into Santa Barbara harbour . “ You 've not been here recently , Captain Harker , ” he said . “ You 'll not know the place ; it 's a different place : almost a different city . They 're making this place the Athens of the West : I say _ they _ , but it 's really _ he _ , the Dictator , Don Manuel . Look at the cathedral ; there 'll be nothing so beautiful in the New World when it 's finished . Do you see your ship , the _ Pathfinder _ ? ” “ No , Sir James , she is n't in the sailing ship berths . ” “ That is unfortunate for you , ” Sir James said , “ as I suppose it means that she has both come and gone ; but it is fortunate for me , for I hope it will mean that you will come home with us in the _ Yuba _ . ” * * * * * PART FOUR As soon as Sard was free , he went ashore to see Messrs. Wrattson & Willis 's agents . He was puzzled by the _ Pathfinder 's _ not being in the port . She could not be overdue , he thought , in just dropping down to leeward . She might have come and gone : in which case he would have missed her by a few hours . “ More probably , ” he thought , “ she has gone down the coast to Otorin to complete her cargo . I 'll find her there . ” At the agents , as he asked for his letters , one of the managers of the firm , a tall , alert inscrutable man of about thirty - five , a Mr. Waycock , heard his name . “ Are you Mr. Harker of the _ Pathfinder _ , ” he said , “ come into my office , will you ? I want to speak to you . Sit down here : the cigars are at your elbow . You do n't smoke ? You 're the first sailor I 've ever known who could say that . You know , Mr. Harker , ” he said , “ I heard that we might expect you apart from the _ Pathfinder _ . I had news of you from a man with whom I have business dealings , a man called Douglas Castleton . ” “ Has he been here ? ” Sard asked . “ Where is he ? ” “ Is n't that	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
it would mean , of course , that I am mad . Or , perhaps it would mean that I am sane . God knows ! There is only one thing definite . Florence did not visit my room last night . Yes , and another thing . The phantoms still crawl around in me . My first emotion when I saw her at the train was again the sentence , ‘ I am guilty . ' It sprang to life once more as it had the moment I leaned over the body .... ” The cab was stopping . De Medici sighed and opened the door . Furtively his eyes watched the half animate girl as Dr. Lytton helped her from the cab . She appeared indifferent to the situation . De Medici , overcome with anguish at the sight of her pallor and listlessness , took her hand and pressed its cold fingers . “ Florence , ” he whispered , “ is there anything I can do ? ” Her dark eyes opened full on his face and an incredible intuition passed through him . She was acting ! Her collapse , her manner , was entirely a pretense . Dr. Lytton returned from the chauffeur . “ Come , hurry . We 'll have to take care of her first . ” In the apartment the doctor became somewhat officious . He appeared to be treasuring dénouements , his manner toward De Medici growing condescending . De Medici , inwardly confused and victim again of the elaborate fears which had darkened his days since the murder of his friend , stood quietly against the wine - colored curtains and waited . “ Whatever he has found out , ” he thought , “ is valueless or at least of no value as a finale . For there is still the dagger lady who visited me last night to explain away . ” He smiled cautiously , convinced anew that this creature was no more than a phantom evolved as an alibi by his own cunning madness . “ Yet , I never felt more normal in my life , ” he murmured to himself , “ unless my madness or hallucinations are able to create a sense of normality in me . If I was mad last night , when the thing happened , then it is obvious that I am mad at this moment . For I am conscious of no different sense or state of mind . And it becomes obvious that I have been thoroughly mad ever since I can remember , and that what I consider my normality has been no more than a cunning pose with which I deceived myself . ” Dr. Lytton turned to him . He had removed the girl 's wraps . “ We will have to put her in bed , ” he remarked . “ She 's had a hard day . ” De Medici	Medici sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er .
. Now , what we want to do is to fix this on McCormick . Is there anything in the room that belongs to him ? ” Peter thought , and at last remembered that in the bookshelves were some books which had been donated by McCormick , and which had his name written in . That was the trick ! exclaimed Nell . They would hide the paper in one of these books , and when the police made a thorough search they would find it . Nell asked what was in these books , and Peter thought , and remembered that one was a book on sabotage . “ Put the paper in that , ” said Nell . “ When the police find it , the newspapers'll print the whole book . ” Peter 's knees were trembling so that he could hardly walk , but he kept reminding himself that he was a “ he - man , ” a 100 % American , and that in these times of war every patriot must do his part . His part was to help rid the country of these Reds , and he must not flinch . They made their way to the old building in which the I. W. W. headquarters were located , and Peter climbed up on the fence and swung over to the fire - escape , and Nell very carefully handed the suit - case to him , and Peter opened the damaged window and slipped into the room . He knew just where the cupboard was , and quickly stored the suit - case in the corner , and piled some odds and ends of stuff in front of it , and threw an old piece of canvas over it . He took out of his right - hand pocket a typewritten letter , and tore it into small pieces and threw them into the trash - basket . Then he took out of his left - hand pocket the other paper , with the drawing of Ackerman 's house . He went to the bookcase and with shaking fingers struck a match , picked out the little redbound book entitled “ Sabotage , ” and stuck the paper inside , and put the book back in place . Then he climbed out on the fire - escape and dropped to the ground , jumped over the fence , and hurried down the alley to where Nell was waiting for him . “ It 's for my country ! ” he was whispering to himself . Section 43 The job was now complete , except for getting McCormick to the rendezvous next morning . Nell had prepared and would mail in the postoffice a special delivery letter addressed to McCormick 's home . This would be delivered about seven o'clock in the morning , and inside was a typewritten note , as follows : “ Mac : Come to Room 17	Nell sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , sabotierte es , , esabotage .
the rear door . He ran over to its side — to discover it was the gardener and that he was dead — shot . He was so dazed for a moment that he did nothing . Then he went to the phone and called us . It was a simple story , and yet an amazing one . That in the space of one hour — in the time it took Patton to go to a store and buy some tobacco — another murder had been committed in the scientist 's library ; it seemed almost beyond belief . But that the gardener — a simple - minded man of his type — should be the victim was even more startling . I started to voice my thought , but Carter was ahead of me . “ But , John ! Why — why under God should any person kill that gardener ? ” “ They never intended to kill the gardener , ” came Ranville 's dry voice . Bartley gave him a keen look , commenting : “ Ranville is right . No one ever intended to kill the gardener . They wanted — that is , if they wished to kill any one — to murder Patton . ” “ But , ” came Patton 's wailing voice , “ why should any one wish to kill me ? ” Bartley 's eyes met Ranville 's , and it was the Englishman who spoke : “ I am not so sure that they intended to kill you , Patton . Though if any one was to be killed , why you were the logical victim . What I think happened was this : they thought they killed you . You and the gardener are about the same build . You are both wearing a dark suit to - day , and your height is the same . When they shot at that man , they thought they were shooting you . ” “ But — ” Patton started in a bewildered voice . He was interrupted by Bartley 's statement : “ Ranville is right , I think ; but we might go even further . It is my idea that the murderer never discovered who it was he killed . He thought he killed Patton . ” “ How do you make that out ? ” was Carter 's question . “ I may be wrong , you understand . But it seems to me something like this happened . The gardener , when he said he could see any one come up the path , forgot it was an easy matter for a person to land on the shore in a boat . The trees would hide him from any person down by the gate . I have an idea also that the gardener never hurried about coming to the library .

you had got underneath his surly manners . He had never done anything except just to grumble , and to put his grumbles into verses ; they were making a mistake in whipping him , and for a moment Peter had a crazy impulse to interfere and tell them so . The poet never made a sound . Peter got one glimpse of his face in the blazing white light , and in spite of the fact that it was smashed and bloody , Peter read Tom Duggan 's resolve -- he would die before they would get a moan out of him . Each time the lash fell you could see a quiver all over his form ; but there was never a sound , and he stood , hugging the tree in a convulsive grip . They lashed him until the whip was spattering blood all over them , until blood was running to the ground . They had taken the precaution to bring along a doctor with a little black case , and he now stepped up and whispered to the master of ceremonies . They unfastened Duggan , and broke the grip of his arms about the tree , and dumped him down beside Glikas . Next came the turn of Donald Gordon , the Socialist Quaker , which brought a bit of cheap drama . Donald took his religion seriously ; he was always shouting his anti - war sentiments in the name of Jesus , which made him especially obnoxious . Now he saw a chance to get off one of his theatrical stunts ; he raised his two manacled hands into the air as if he were praying , and shouted in piercing tones : “ Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do ! ” A murmur started in the crowd ; you could hear it mounting to a roar . “ Blasphemy ! ” they cried . “ Stop his dirty mouth ! ” It was the same mouth that had been heard on a hundred platforms , denouncing the war and those who made money out of the war . They were here now , the men who had been denounced , the younger members of the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants ' and Manufacturers ' Association , the best people of the city , those who were saving the country , and charging no more than the service was worth . So they roared with fury at this sacreligious upstart . A man whose mask was a joke , because he was so burly and hearty that everybody in the crowd knew him , took up the bloody whip . It was Billy Nash , secretary of the “ Improve America League , ” and the crowd shouted , “ Go to it , Billy ! Good eye , old boy ! ” Donald Gordon might tell God that Billy Nash did n't know	' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' 
having stalked her victim surely , relentlessly , all the morning , now was about to close in upon her . She had sent emissary after emissary down the show - boat aisle , and each had helped to deepen the look of terror in Julie 's eyes . Now sounded the slow shambling heavy tread of Windy the pilot , bearded , sombre , ominous as the figure of fate itself . The little group turned toward him automatically , almost absurdly , like a badly directed mob scene in one of their own improbable plays . He clumped up the little flight of steps that led from the lower left - hand box to the stage . Clump , clump , clump . Irresistibly Parthy 's eyes peered sharply in pursuit of the muddy tracks that followed each step . She snorted indignantly . Across the stage , his beard waggling up and down as his jaws worked slowly , rhythmically on a wedge of Honest Scrap . As he approached Julie 's doorway he took off his cap and rubbed his pate with his palm , sure sign of great mental perturbation in this monumental old leviathan . The yellow skin of his knobby bald dome - like head shone gold in the rays of the late morning sun that came in through the high windows at the side of the stage . He stood a moment , chewing , and peering mildly into the dimness of the bedroom , Sphinx - like , it seemed that he never would speak . He stood , champing . The _ Cotton Blossom _ troupe waited . They had not played melodrama for years without being able to sense it when they saw it . He spoke . “ Seems that skunk Pete 's up to something . ” They waited . The long tobacco - stained beard moved up and down , up and down . “ Skinned out half an hour back streaking toward town like possessed . He yanked that picture of Julie out of the hall there . Seen him . I see good deal goes on around here . ” Steve sprang to his feet with a great ripping river oath . “ I 'll kill him this time , the — — ” “ Seen you take that first picture out , Steve . ” The deep red that had darkened Steve 's face and swelled the veins on his great neck receded now , leaving his china - blue eyes staring out of a white and stricken face . “ I never did ! I never did ! ” Julie sat up , clutching her wrapper at the throat . She laughed shrilly . “ What would he want to steal my picture for ! His own wife 's picture . Likely ! ” “ So nobody in this town'd see it , Julie , ” said Windy , mildly . “	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
: “ You know where he is ? ” The housekeeper hesitated for a second , then replied : “ Yes . He is in his library . You know , Mr. Carter , that his study and library is in that stone building on the hill . He spends his afternoons there writing on his new book . I know he went there this afternoon . And — ” the voice trailed off into silence . “ And what ? ” came Ranville 's low voice . The woman raised her head and her eyes swept over the three of us . There was not only a look of anxiety in them but , I thought , also a trace of fear . But why there should be the last I failed to understand . But fear there was . She started to speak , hesitated a second , as if she did not wish to put into words what was in her mind , and then suddenly said in a voice which shook a little : “ Only — I do n't know what to say . I have called up his library a dozen times , and he does not answer . I went down to the building and called his name , but no answer . Then I tried the door , and it was locked — and he never locks the door when he is working . Then I pounded on the door , but still no one said anything in reply . And — ” Once again came silence , and the look of fear crept again across her face . She gave us one bewildered appealing look and wailed : “ He ought to be in his library . I know he was there , but he wo n't answer the phone , and he did not come to the door . And when I knocked I thought — ” For a moment she paused again . For some reason none of us spoke . Our eyes were upon the frightened face of the woman , whose nervous fingers were never still . And then all at once she lifted her head and completed the sentence . “ And when I knocked at the door , I thought I heard something move inside the library . ” Chapter II The Crooked Cross There fell a silence for a moment — a silence in which the housekeeper moved nervously over to a near - by chair . Carter 's air of boredom had vanished , and a quick look passed between his English friend and himself ; a glance which held until the English police officer slowly nodded his head . Then came Carter 's cool voice , with the suggestion that we might go to the summer house and see if Warren was there .

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED . PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS , GARDEN CITY , N. Y. = To= = Winthrop Ames= = Who First Said Show Boat= = to Me= INTRODUCTION “ Show Boat ” is neither history nor biography , but fiction . This statement is made in the hope that it will forestall such protest as may be registered by demon statisticians against certain liberties taken with characters , places , and events . In the Chicago portion of the book , for example , a character occasionally appears some three or four years after the actual date of his death . Now and then a restaurant or gambling resort is described as running full blast at a time when it had vanished at the frown of civic virtue . This , then , was done , not through negligence in research , but because , in the attempt to give a picture of the time , it was necessary slightly to condense a period of fifteen or twenty years . E. F. _ SHOW BOAT _ I Bizarre as was the name she bore , Kim Ravenal always said she was thankful it had been no worse . She knew whereof she spoke , for it was literally by a breath that she had escaped being called Mississippi . “ Imagine Mississippi Ravenal ! ” she often said , in later years . “ They 'd have cut it to Missy , I suppose , or even Sippy , if you can bear to think of anything so horrible . And then I 'd have had to change my name or give up the stage altogether . Because who 'd go to see — seriously , I mean — an actress named Sippy ? It sounds half - witted , for some reason . Kim 's bad enough , God knows . ” And as Kim Ravenal you doubtless are familiar with her . It is no secret that the absurd monosyllable which comprises her given name is made up of the first letters of three states — Kentucky , Illinois , and Missouri — in all of which she was , incredibly enough , born — if she can be said to have been born in any state at all . Her mother insists that she was n't . If you were an habitué of old South Clark Street in Chicago 's naughty ' 90s you may even remember her mother , Magnolia Ravenal , as Nola Ravenal , soubrette — though Nola Ravenal never achieved the doubtful distinction of cigarette pictures .

credentials for her ducal blazon . The high rank she held at the Court of Frederick Christian II was indeed matter of common knowledge , further , that she was honoured by the very special friendship of the Prince Gudulfin was whispered in private conclave ; but this pretty well summed up the total of what society in general did know about her . But it is never the custom , so long as a woman is rich , beautiful and witty , so long as no open scandal attaches to her name , to be over - exacting as to details ? At any rate , each time the grand duchess threw open her drawing rooms for one of the superb and sumptuous entertainments she was in the habit of giving , no eagerness was too shameless to secure an invitation , no one but was only too proud and happy to be numbered among her guests . Though it was already May , the Grand Duchess Alexandra was to - night giving a fancy - dress ball . This had long been promised , but having been postponed in consequence of the great lady 's being indisposed , was at last fixed for this belated period of the season . It was eleven o'clock , and guests were beginning to arrive , carriages driving up in rapid succession to the steps of the villa , one after the other depositing masked figures , some baffling , some charming , in costumes borrowed from legend , history , in some cases even recalling contemporary politics . Dancing had not yet commenced , all were devoting their energies to applauding , enthusiastically applauding , the most becoming dresses , the most ingenious disguises , as they appeared . The evening was delicious , the mild spring weather perfect , so that the masquers could gather under the wide awning that sheltered the steps and there welcome each new arrival . The general attention was beginning to flag , and the duchess herself , abandoning the attempt to shake every new arrival by the hand — their number made the task impossible — was about to return to the reception rooms , where the Gipsy orchestra had just struck up one of their softest and most melodious waltz tunes , when a magnificent automobile drew up at the steps . The car roused no little curiosity by the fact that its blinds were drawn down so as to make it impossible to see who was inside . Instinctively almost , as sometimes happens , the talk grew hushed ; heads were turned and necks craned to see . Staying momentarily the play of her ever - moving fan , the grand duchess herself seemed to be puzzled as she eagerly awaited the newcomer , whose very sex was still a secret . Then the door of the car opened at last ; and suddenly through the crowd , till then so	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
; they became unimportant fragmentary interludes . This was her life . She had never left it . They would be there — Julie , and Steve , and Windy , and Doc , and Parthy , and Andy , and Schultzy — somehow , they would be there . They were real . The others were dream people : Mike McDonald , Hankins , Hetty Chilson , all that raffish Chicago crew ; the New York group — Kim 's gay , fly , brittle brilliant crowd with which Magnolia had always assumed an ease she did not feel . She decided , sensibly , that she was tired , a little dazed , even . She had slept scarcely at all the night before . Perhaps this news of her mother 's death had been , after all , more of a shock than she thought . She would not pretend to be grief - stricken . The breach between her and the indomitable old woman had been a thing of many years ' standing , and it had grown wider and wider with the years following that day when , descending upon her daughter in Chicago , Mrs. Hawks had learned that the handsome dashing Gaylord Ravenal had flown . She had been unable to resist her triumphant , “ What did I tell you ! ” It had been the last straw . She had wondered , vaguely , what sort of conveyance she might hire to carry her to Cold Spring , for she knew no railroad passed through this little river town . But when she descended from the train at this , the last stage but one in her wearisome journey , there was a little group at the red brick station to meet her . A man came toward her ( he turned out to be the Chas . K. Barnato of the telegram ) . He was the general manager and press agent . Doc 's old job , modernized . “ How did you know me ? ” she had asked , and was startled when he replied : “ You look like your ma . ” Then , before she could recover from this : “ But Elly told me it was you . ” A rather amazing old lady came toward her . She looked like the ancient ruins of a bisque doll . Her cheeks were pink , her eyes bright , her skin parchment , her hat incredible . “ Do n't you remember me , Nollie ? ” she said . And pouted her withered old lips . Then , as Magnolia stared , bewildered , she had chirped like an annoyed cockatoo , “ Elly Chipley — Lenore La Verne . ” “ But it is n't possible ! ” Magnolia had cried . This had appeared to annoy Miss Chipley afresh . “ Why not , I 'd like to know ! I	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
weight of a marline - spike . It had been bent a little . In its day it had had a good deal of battering . It was rusty , but very well fitted to be a punch to drift out other pebbles . Using a pebble as a mallet , Sard was making good progress when a low voice called him : “ Kid ! ” “ Who 's there ? ” he asked . “ Say , Kid , do n't make any noise , but come right up to the hole there . ” Sard came cautiously , half expecting a missile through the hole . He saw that the hole was blocked by a man 's face , which so shut out the light that he could not recognise it . “ Say , Kid . ” The face swung away from the hole , for the stone on which the man was standing slipped a little . Sard recognised the ugly - looking train - hand who had watched him from the after - car . “ Say , Kid , ” the man repeated , as he clawed back into position , “ you wanna get quit of here , or you 'll line the cold - meat cart . ” “ I 'm trying to get quit , ” Sard said . “ Well , you wanna try pretty dam ' hard . You was on the silver line and you ai n't got any plunks , I guess . ” “ No . ” “ Well , you wanna get out before sundown , sport . These silver - escort guys , they 'll keep a man till sundown , to see if he 'll pay to be let out . If he ca n't , they bring him into the yard ‘ for exercise ' and shoot him full of holes . If any question 's asked , they say they shot him while he was trying to escape . What the hell did you stay on the train for till she pulled up ? I gave you the flag to beat it , and you put your dam ' hoof right on it . ” “ I thought you were going to shoot me , ” Sard said . “ Anyhow , I could not have jumped from the train , because my leg is queer . ” “ Hell ! ” the man said . “ You ai n't got ten plunks ? ” “ No . ” “ I mean , sewed away anywheres , against an emergency ? ” “ I have n't a penny . ” “ Because if you have ten plunks , you 're up against your emergency , do n't you make any mistake . ” “ I have n't a farthing . ” “ Hell ! ” the man said , “ I was cleaned out at pinochle myself , only last	, ” he said , “ ai n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ n't got n't , ” he said , “ n't got n't got , ” he said , “ n't got n't got , ” he said , “ n't got n't got , ” he said , “ n't got n't ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got n't got ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” ” he said , “ n't got n't , ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't got n't ” he said , “ n't got n't got n't got

All recognized the man , it was the young Frenchman , the same who had given himself out as a medical student . Mrs. Bigelow had come to take a peep at Tom Bob 's prisoner , and now rejoined Sonia Danidoff : “ It is quite true , my dear , ” she confided to the princess , “ Mr. Bob was quite right , one must beware of people who are ill shod ; that man wore horrid bad boots . ” The princess was very pale and still quite unstrung : “ It 's frightful , these things , appalling ; it has made me quite ill ! ” Meantime the compartment into which , finding it by chance unoccupied , the American detective had unceremoniously pushed his prisoner , resounded with a chorus of indignant outcries against the pseudo - student . As quick as lightning the police - officer had secured the fellow 's wrists with a miniature pair of handcuffs , so small as to be hardly visible , but strong enough to bear any strain . The Superintendent now appeared on the scene much harassed by all these varied incidents , on which he would have to make a circumstantial report , a task made the more difficult by the fact that the worthy official , having no actual knowledge of the details , was asking himself which of the two parties was actually in the right and which in the wrong , these foreign fashionables travelling without tickets or the young Parisian whom an American police - officer had taken upon himself to handcuff . “ I do n't wish to hear a word , ” declared the Superintendent , “ I 'm not going to decide between you , you will make your explanations to the Special Constabulary at the terminus . ” “ Nothing could be fairer , ” Tom Bob agreed , adding with characteristic phlegm : “ At the same time , sir , if you wish here and now to have the two missing tickets , all you have to do is to search that young gentleman 's pockets , I have no doubt they are in his possession . ” “ I prefer to do nothing , ” insisted the official , shaking his head in a puzzled way , “ I shall do nothing , you will explain yourselves , as I said before , to the Constabulary Office at Saint - Lazare . ” * * * * * A quarter of an hour later , still in a state of breathless excitement , the first class passengers of the Trans - Atlantic express arrived at their journey 's end . Instead of leaving the station , they all waited in silence on the platform where the train had pulled up , formed up in two lines	” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” 
"uncomfortably , and he flushed still redder when Bob suddenly straightened up and met his eye . Both men stood alert , held tensely by the same sound . It was the low music of a girlish voice humming a snatch of song , and it was accompanied by the soft crackling of the needles that carpeted the grove of pine between the Spence and Brewster houses . In another instant Delight Hathaway strolled slowly out of the wood and entered the workshop . With her coming a radiance of sunshine seemed to flood the shabby room . She nodded a greeting to Bob , then went straight to Willie and , placing her hands affectionately on his shoulders , looked down into his face . They made a pretty picture , the bent old man with his russet cheeks and thin white hair , and the girl erect as an arrow and beautiful as a young Diana .

It was six o'clock in the evening , and already the tallow dips had been lighted . They cast a flickering , friendly glow over the scene , the long , low room , stone - flagged and small - windowed , the ale barrels and rum kegs neatly arranged side by side on a form which ran nearly all the way round the wall , and the two long , trestled tables , flanked with high - backed seats which were now unoccupied , but were presently to be filled with the best company that the east of the Island could provide . Besides Gilbot , who appeared happily oblivious of all around him , four other persons sat in the Ship kitchen : two old men threw dice for pence in one corner , while in another , between two rum kegs , sat a girl . She was about twenty - three years of age , and , although her appearance was not of that uncommon type so marked in Anny Farran , yet she had a certain quiet comeliness and gentle expression which made her almost beautiful . At least the handsome young giant who lounged near her in an ecstasy of shyness appeared to think so , for he eyed her so intently , his mouth partly open , that she was forced to pay more attention to the garment she was patching than was strictly necessary . They sat in perfect silence for some ten minutes before the young man plucked up courage to speak . When he did , his voice came uncomfortably from his throat , and he reddened to the roots of his hair . “ I reckon I 'll be going up west now , Mistress Sue , ” he said , as he half rose to his feet and looked toward the door . “ Oh!”--there was a note of real regret in the girl 's voice--“must you go so early , Master French ? ” Big French sat down again quickly . “ Nay , ” he said shortly , and there was silence again for another minute or so . She stitched busily the while . “ Is it	“ Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , ” he said , he sat in the corner of the kitchen , and sat in the corner of the room , and sat in the corner of the room , and sat in the corner of the room , and sat in the corner of the room , and sat in the corner of the room , and sat in the corner of the room , and sat in the corner of the room , and sat in the corner of the room , in the corner of the kitchen .
of a United States senator ? And what difference did it make whether a thing was in the Declaration of Independence , if it was seditious , if it was n't allowed to be said ? This incident brought Guffey and the police authorities of the city so much ridicule that Guffey got all his men together and read them a lecture , explaining to them just what were the limits of the anti - Red activities , just who it was they must n't arrest , and just what it was they could n't keep people from saying . For example , a man could n't be arrested for quoting the Bible . “ But Jesus Christ , Guffey , ” broke in one of the men , “ have all of us got to know the Bible by heart ? ” There was a laugh all round . “ No , ” Guffey admitted , “ but at least be careful , and do n't arrest anybody for saying anything that sounds as if it came from the Bible . ” “ But hell ! ” put in another of the men , who happened to be an ex - preacher . “ That 'll tie us up tighter than a jail - sentence ! Look what 's in the Bible ! ” And he proceeded to quote some of the things , and Peter knew that he had never heard any Bolshevik talk more outrageous than that . It made one realize more than ever how complicated was this Red problem ; for Guffey insisted , in spite of everything , that every word out of the Bible was immune . “ Up in Winnipeg , ” said he , “ they indicted a clergyman for quoting two passages from the prophet Isaiah , but they could n't face it , they had to let the fellow go . ” And the same thing was true of the Declaration of Independence ; anybody might read it , no matter how seditious it was . And the same thing was true of the Constitution , even tho the part called the Bill of Rights declared that everybody in America might do all the things that Guffey 's office was sending them to jail for doing ! This seemed a plain crazy proposition ; but Guffey explained it as a matter of politics . If they went too far , these fellows would go out and capture the votes from them , and maybe take away the government from them , and where would they be then ? Peter had never paid any attention to politics before this , but both he and Gladys realized after this lecture that they must broaden their view - point . It was not enough to put the Reds in jail and crack their skulls , you had to keep public sympathy for what you were doing , you had to make the	Guffey , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah eseditious , n't , eseditious , n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ ” he , ” he said , ” he said , “ n't go to jail , ” he said , “ n't go to jail , ” he said .
out from beneath her elbow . To Mrs. Hawks ' intense disgust , Julie fed the tiny creature out of her own dish . In her cabin its bed was an old sealskin muff from whose depths its mournful dark eyes looked appealingly out from a face that was like nothing so much as that of an old old baby . “ I declare , ” Parthy would protest , almost daily , “ it fairly turns a body 's stomach to see her eating out of the same dish with that dirty little rat . ” “ Why , Mama ! it is n't a rat any such thing ! It 's a monkey and you know it . Julie says maybe Schultzy can get one for me in New Orleans if I promise to be very very careful of it . ” “ I 'd like to see her try , ” grimly putting an end to that dream . The women took care of their own cabins . The detail of this occupied them until mid - morning . Often there was a rehearsal at ten that lasted an hour or more . Schultzy announced it at breakfast . As they swept up a river , or floated down , their approach to the town was announced by the shrill iron - throated calliope , pride of Captain Andy 's heart . Its blatant voice heralded the coming of the show boat long before the boat itself could be seen from the river bank . It had solid brass keys and could plainly be heard for five miles . George , who played the calliope , was also the pianist . He was known , like all calliope players , as the Whistler . Magnolia delighted in watching him at the instrument . He wore a slicker and a slicker hat and heavy gloves to protect his hands , for the steam of the whistles turned to hot raindrops and showered his hands and his head and shoulders as he played . As they neared the landing , the band , perched atop the show boat , forward , alternated with the calliope . From the town , hurrying down the streets , through the woods , dotting the levee and the landing , came eager figures , black and white . Almost invariably some magic - footed Negro , overcome by the music , could be seen on the wharf executing the complicated and rhythmic steps of a double shuffle , his rags flapping grotesquely about him , his mouth a gash of white . By nine o'clock in the morning every human being within a radius of five miles knew that the Cotton Blossom Floating Palace Theatre had docked at the waterfront . By half - past eleven the band , augmented by two or three men of the company who doubled in brass , must be ready for the morning concert on the main	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
To repeat the Ballau crime and distract suspicion from the creature in Rollo . There 's a terrible logic to the thing . Florence under a mania worse than her mother 's ... the mania of sacrifice ....

The burned letter ... all part of her plan . There is no Floria .... She 's saving me from a crime she thinks I committed .... ” Again his thought stopped and a sigh escaped him . He had been trying to build himself against the despair that lacerated his heart . “ No , ” he repeated , “ no . It was she last night in my room . A false attack . She did n't mean murder . It was made merely as a gesture to establish her mother 's innocence . Hm , but I know better than that . The dagger plunged for my heart .... Too clear a memory to evade . My arm saved me .... A crazed woman . And what else ? Oh , yes , the laugh . I remember .... She laughed . After the dagger had struck , she laughed .... And it was her voice . I remember now . Florence 's voice , wild and crazed , laughing over me ... after the dagger had struck .... ” The knowledge which overcame him sickened his thought . His face had become drawn . Fears ached in his heart . “ Worthy of other days , ” he whispered . “ Yes , a plot out of De Medici annals . But I must find her . Unless I find her I 'll go mad myself .... ” He looked up and saw ahead of him the Hudson Apartments . He had , without thinking of destination , walked toward the Ballau home . “ She 'll be there , ” he murmured with sudden conviction .

baulked his praiseworthy efforts , for the glass after some frantic oscillations suddenly turned topsy turvy , spilling the wine over the carpet . The accident provoked an uproarious fit of wild mirth from Ascott : “ Oh ! there is no doubt about it , the old man is awfully drunk . ” And now the young Englishman 's cup of happiness was filled to the brim , as he heard the other declare : “ Why , yes , I do n't feel very well , my head 's going round a bit . With your leave , I 'll go out and breathe the fresh air a minute ; but none of your nonsense now whilst I 'm away ! Ascott , I count on your good behaviour , I entrust that dear , good , virtuous child to your care”—and Père Moche disappeared . Scarcely was he out of the room before Ascott shook off his intoxication and managed to rise from the divan on which he sprawled . Stepping to the door of the private room , he shot the bolt with an unsteady hand ; then , regardless of Nini 's hypocritical prayers and protests , he went to the switch and turned off the electric current . “ Oh ! sir , sir ! ” shrilled the girl in a terrified voice , “ what are you doing ? ... oh ! ... for God 's sake , let me be ... mother ! ” Meantime , no sooner was Moche out in the passage leading to the private rooms than he recovered all his coolness and self - possession , as if by a miracle . The old scamp was much too astute to have let himself get tipsy ; it was simply a piece of play - acting he had been at for the benefit of his host , a comedy that did not in the least take in his confidante and accomplice , Nini Guinon , though it completely bamboozled the young Englishman . With no small satisfaction Moche noted — as indeed the landlord had led him to expect when he came that morning to order the little dinner — that the adjoining rooms were unoccupied . After that he made sure that no one could spy on them from the floor below . Everything was as it should be . The host of the _ Silver Goblet _ was used to these little private entertainments and knew it was not the proper thing to disturb those attending them under any circumstances . No doubt , somewhere about one o'clock in the morning , a waiter would come up to announce that it was time to be leaving , as the house was going to be shut up , but till that hour guests could count implicitly on the most absolute peace and quietness .

not stop to listen to the American 's praises of the Bois de Boulogne . He crossed the little wooden bridge joining the two parts of the island , made sure that the officers he had sent there in the afternoon were at their posts , ordered them to keep a most careful watch all night on the lake and its approaches , then made his way back to Tom Bob . “ You are coming ? ” “ I am quite ready . ” The detective got up , paid the bill for his dinner , and took another cigar , while M. Havard , faithful to his usual habits , refused the Havana Tom Bob offered him and drew a cigarette from his case . The two police - officials left the restaurant and made for the landing , where the ferry - boat was again putting in . “ Get in , ” M. Havard urged the American . “ After you ! ” protested the Head of the Criminal Bureau . “ Halloa , have you a light about you ? Will you pass me a match , I have n't got one . ” Tom Bob looked at his cigar . “ I 'm not well alight myself , ” he said , and pulling a box of vestas from his pocket , he lit one , handed it to M. Havard , then took it back and applied it to his own cigar ; then , as the match was beginning to burn his fingers , he tossed it into the lake . But then , suddenly , with terrifying intensity , with an incredible rapidity , a fantastic , unheard - of , appalling thing happened . The very instant the burning match touched the water , the lake caught fire and blazed up fiercely , giving off dense clouds of smoke and sending up huge flickering flames of red and blue that instantly covered the whole surface with a sheet of fire . Fortunately Tom Bob had managed to grip M. Havard by the arm and drag him back from the boat he was just getting into , and both started running breathlessly for the middle of the island , accompanied as they went by the various employés of the _ Azaïs _ , the manager and a few customers who were still on the premises , all flying headlong before the flames . The sight was fairylike , unforgettable , but tragic to the last degree . The whole lake indeed was a veritable sea of fire , which the eye could not pierce . From this gigantic brazier a sooty smoke went up in swirling eddies , instantly veiling the sky with thick , heavy clouds . The heat was terrific , so intense that the sweat rolled in torrents down the faces of the unfortunates imprisoned on the island . The air indeed was almost unbreathable .

- fitting tights . His shoulders were draped in a dark cloak , the face was invisible behind a cowl , a black mask ! A figure of horror , a very incarnation of crime , a form of terror without a name ! It was the form of Fantômas , come in the night to inspect the work of the roadmen engaged in preparations for to - morrow 's fête ! * * * * * The hour was divine , the scene fascinating in its charm and seduction , at once sumptuous and refined . Nor was the setting less delightful , this elegant restaurant , this favourite haunt of fashion , where the invited guests one and all belonged to the wealthy aristocracy of Paris ; supper was drawing to an end , the talk grew more brilliant than ever , the music was ravishing , the women lovely , the perfumes intoxicating , the flowers a feast for the eyes ! No less than everything else the mysterious hues of the foliage , a weird tint of blue painted by the gleam of the electric lights , contributed to lend this corner of the Bois a look of unreality , a fairylike aspect like some fantastic scene on the stage , charming , delicious , entrancing ! This evening the place was even more brilliantly lighted than usual . The papers had made much of the coming festivity ; in celebration of a treaty of Commerce signed the previous week , the English Ambassador was paying this compliment to his colleague the Ambassador of Russia . Dinner was served at separate little tables . It was past midnight , the meal was almost over and conversation was more animated than ever . Apart from the other guests , at a table set at a distance from the others , sat dining quite alone a very beautiful woman , of an irreproachable elegance and one who , better still than Sonia Danidoff , could claim the rank of Royal Highness . The waiters named her to each other with baited breath : “ Her Highness the Grand Duchess Alexandra . ” It was in fact the haughty great lady , friend of Frederick Christian IV , King of Hesse - Weimar , the proud lady whom Juve and Fandor , and they alone , knew to be in reality the enigmatic Lady Beltham , the mistress of Fantômas ! And truly , if some observer had chosen to watch the pretty woman in question , he would have shuddered to note with what a look , at once tragic and distraught , full of hate and violent animosity , she gazed at her gay and laughing neighbours , the guests of the Ambassadors of England and of Russia . It would seem indeed that the grand duchess had some secret motive for wishing to remain unseen by these members of Parisian society . Not content with choosing

The tin was not honestly earned , and it burns our fingers ! ” With a look of disgust the apache tossed on to the young man 's knees the four gold coins , which rolled under the bed . Père Moche broke in : “ Such , Monsieur le Commissaire , are the facts as they occurred — you know them yourself , sir ; indeed , M. Ascott does not deny them . Besides which , the presence in his house of my unhappy niece , a mere child , sir , barely sixteen years of age , whom he has odiously wronged , is surely the best proof of guilt ... ” But Moche never finished his sentence .

He was in the middle of a vast shed ; on either side he saw the roofs of carriages stretching away into infinity . For a moment he was at a loss what to think , then the truth burst upon him . “ Damnation ! ” he cried , “ was it worth my while to lay my plans so carefully , and make such a monstrous mistake after all ! ” Instead of taking the train for Hâvre , he had got on to a line of empty coaches which a yard - engine was simply hauling out to its siding for the night . Even as he realized the fact , in the distance , full steam ahead and brilliantly lighted up , he saw a main line train go by — the Hâvre train without a doubt !

As usual , her passenger list was a full one , and bore many names well known in the worlds of high finance and fashion . The decks were crowded with pretty women in brilliant toilettes and clean - shaven , keen - faced men in check cloth caps , a typically American company , not to mention a minority of other nationalities — Frenchmen , Englishmen , heavily built Germans , with a sprinkling of Spaniards and Italians and even a half - dozen bronzed Asiatics , a cosmopolitan assemblage . The great ship lay alongside the huge customs shed , at the further side of which was drawn up the special boat - train destined to convey the liner 's first class passengers to Paris , and only waiting the latter 's release from the formalities of the _ douane _ . Now all was ready , and the heavy train got into motion , threaded its way at a snail 's pace through the vast labyrinth of docks and warehouses , made a brief halt at the Hâvre railway station to pick up a few travellers having special permission to avail themselves of this express service , then little by little gathering speed , began the headlong race that was only to end 300 kilometres from the start at the Gare Saint - Lazare in the very heart of the capital . Very soon _ déjeuner _ was served in the dining coach . “ How pretty the country is , ” said Mrs. Silas K. Bigelow , enthusiastically ; she was a young and charming American , who sat with eyes never leaving the window , gazing with admiring curiosity at the fertile plains of Normandy whirling past	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
dashed against the shore . By the aid of another flash of lightning , we glimpsed for a second the dark figure . This time he was almost by a small building which faced the water . As we reached Bartley 's side , Carter gasped : “ I think I know where the man is going . There is a stone boat house down there . ” I wondered later why it was we were not observed , for as the man reached the boat house , we heard him fumble with the lock , and the door was slammed almost in our faces . We stood for a second by the door of the building . It was a small stone affair built of heavy granite blocks . It stood directly upon the shore of the lake , and the water was but a few feet away . As we gazed at the building , suddenly far above our heads came the reflection of a light from within . I gave a start , for the light was directly above us . There came Carter 's quick voice : “ John , this place has no windows at all . It was once a studio , and there is a large skylight in the roof . When I was a kid , I often climbed on the roof and watched the artists working inside . ” “ Can you get up there now ? ” questioned Bartley . “ Without any trouble at all , ” Carter retorted . “ On the other side of the building there is a big tree . You can climb the tree , then go out on a branch and drop on the roof . It 's easy . ” Without a word Bartley rushed around the side of the building , we after him . There we found it was as Carter had said . There was a large tree several yards from the building , and I could see from the light reflected above the roof an overhanging branch . As the limbs hung low , Bartley had no difficulty in climbing , and I saw him drop upon the roof . In rapid succession we followed him . For a moment as the branch swayed with the wind I felt a feeling of suspense , but in a second I dropped lightly on the roof of the building . A large skylight formed the larger part of the roof . From it a light was streaming out into the night . Bending over the skylight , their eyes intent on something in the room below , were Carter and Bartley . Ranville and myself reached the glass at the same moment and bent forward to look into the room . In the first glance I noticed nothing out of the way . There was simply a large , unkempt room , littered with old chairs and odds and ends	Bartley retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he retorted , ” he , ” , ” , ” ” , ” ” , ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ”
for information , and these rewards naturally had many claimants . The trouble was that people who wanted this money generally had records that would n't go well before a jury ; the women nearly always turned out to be prostitutes , and the men to be ex - convicts , forgers , gamblers , or what not . Sometimes they did n't tell their past records until the other side unearthed them , and then it was necessary to doctor court records , and pull wires all over the country . There were a dozen such witnesses as this in the Goober case . They had told their stories before the grand jury , and innumerable flaws and discrepancies had been discovered , which made more work and trouble for Guffey and his lieutenants . Thru a miserable mischance it happened that Jim Goober and his wife had been watching the parade from the roof of a building a couple of miles away , at the very hour when they were accused of having planted the suit - case with the bomb in it . Somebody had taken a photograph of the parade from this roof , which showed both Goober and his wife looking over , and also a big clock in front of a jewelry store , plainly indicating the very minute . Fortunately the prosecution got hold of this photograph first ; but now the defense had learned of its existence , and was trying to get a look at it . The prosecution did n't dare destroy it , because its existence could be proven ; but they had photographed the photograph , and re - photographed that , until they had the face of the clock so dim that the time could not be seen . Now the defense was trying to get evidence that this trick had been worked . Then there were all the witnesses for the defense . Thru another mischance it had happened that half a dozen different people had seen the bomb thrown from the roof of Guggenheim 's Department Store ; which entirely contradicted the suit - case theory upon which the prosecution was based . So now it was necessary to “ reach ” these various witnesses . One perhaps had a mortgage on his home which could be bought and foreclosed ; another perhaps had a wife who wanted to divorce him , and could be persuaded to help get him into trouble . Or perhaps he was engaged in an intrigue with some other man 's wife ; or perhaps some woman could be sent to draw him into an intrigue . Then again , it appeared that very soon after the explosion some of Guffey 's men had taken a sledge hammer and smashed the sidewalk , also the wall of the building where the explosion had taken place . This was to fit in with the theory of the suit - case bomb	Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , n't be , n't be , but , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , Thru , .
call . “ You know I told you before that I know nothing about the murder of Mr. Warren . ” Bartley shot out but one word , “ Maybe . ” Again the eyes of the two men met and for a moment their glances held . Then the Chinaman dropped his eyes to his hands . The long fingers folded and unfolded as though he were playing some game . After a silence he spoke again : “ May I ask what you plan to do with me ? ” “ That depends , ” was Bartley 's slow response . I saw a sudden gleam of interest come into the yellow face , and then it became as impassive as before . One thing was certain : there was not a trace of fear in his manner though it seemed to me he was rather curious as to who Bartley might be . Again he looked at him , and then ventured : “ What is it you wish me to tell you ? ” Bartley 's voice was very impersonal as he replied : “ I am not sure I wish you to tell me anything ; but if you do wish to speak , you might explain how that box of opium got into Warren 's possession . ” It was not a smile that passed over the Chinaman 's face , though his features did move a little . For a moment he let his head sink back against his chair and his eyes partly closed as if he was thinking . Then suddenly he sat upright and said : “ I am perfectly willing to tell you that . It is really very simple . Mr. Warren was given six boxes by a certain gentleman he met in China . They were rare and old ; three were for himself ; the other three he was asked to bring as a gift from this man to a friend of his in America . ” He paused as if reflecting and as he did not speak for a moment , Bartley suggested : “ And three of them contained opium . ” The Chinaman made a slight bow . “ Your wisdom is indeed great , ” was the reply . “ Three of them did . When they were given Mr. Warren , just as he was about to sail for America , he was told that the keys of the boxes were lost . But he was told they would be sent , and should reach him before he unpacked his goods . As they were all coming in duty free because of his scientific standing this man knew that the boxes would not be opened . So marking the three which contained opium , he simply used the scientist as the carrying agent . ” Again he paused , and we could tell that he did not care to say anything	Bartley sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , he sat down .
find the table set for two , furniture overturned , clews everywhere — candlesticks , crucifixes , signs of a great struggle — in the usual second - act climax fashion . It was his intention to set the stage for such a murder . But he was n't himself . He went about his work with the insane deliberation of a man who functions automatically . ” Lieutenant Norton stood up . “ I think we 'll find some among the guests tonight who 'll be able to throw a light on the dead man 's finances and troubles , ” he said . “ In the meantime , we 'll have the body moved and hold it in the undertaking rooms until the inquest . Of course , what I 've outlined here is only the result of first impressions . But , as I 've said , first impressions are usually one 's best conclusions . ” The detective walked out of the room . De Medici rose to follow . As he did an object fell out of the heavy upholstered chair in which he had been sitting . He stooped and picked it up . A woman 's purse . Norton had turned at the door and De Medici slipped it quickly into his pocket . “ An old purse , ” he murmured to himself , “ and there were some faded silver initials in the corner . ” The guests were waiting for him . They crowded around him , babbling questions , exclamations , condolences . “ They 've taken all our names , ” one woman sobbed suddenly . “ Oh , poor , dear Victor .... ” De Medici , his eyes narrowed , his lean face void of expression , moved from group to group assuring them that all was being done that could be done . He tried vainly to obtain a moment 's private talk with Florence . He had learned that she had retired to her bedroom and was locked in with a nurse summoned by Norton . “ She 's in a rather bad condition , ” the detective explained as he saw De Medici prowling in the hallway . “ I think you 'd better leave her alone for the time being . ” “ He 's watching me , ” De Medici thought . “ Every move I make . He 's been standing behind me as I talked . He was in the doorway of the bathroom as I washed my hands . ” He paused in his thought and shivered as a word whimpered somewhere in the recesses of his brain ... “ guilty ... guilty .... ” “ I think I 'll leave , ” Lieutenant Norton remarked suddenly at his side . “ My men will remain here . And I 'll be back early in the morning . ” De Medici watched the detective move through the crowded	De Medici stooped in his chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair , sat down in a chair .

expected them to bellow . They jostled on in myriads till all the lower slopes of the mountains were blotted out . Soon a sea of mist washed all about those miles of Sierras ; the peaks stood out of this sea like islands . “ If that sea rises , ” Sard thought , “ I shall be drowned up here . I must move while I have light . ” He had his direction from the sun . He pushed on , now up , now down , over snow of every degree of rottenness . He had a little food left in his wallet . He guarded this , but slaked his thirst with snow and chewed upon a piece of his belt . In the evening it began to blow bitterly cold with a small snow . In one of the whirls of the gale he found himself upon a piece of a made road . He could hardly believe his eyes ; but there was no doubt : it had been made by men . It had been cut out of the side of the crag ; the crag at its side had been carven with the figures of the gods . A tall god with his tongue transfixed by a bramble was pouring libation on an altar ; beyond the altar was a door leading into the crag . As he stood there , the sun shone out through a rift to light the eyrie he was perched upon . Used as he was to heights , it made him sick to think of the will that had spent men , like water , to hew that rock at that height . The sun shone into the doorway . Looking within , he saw two figures upon a throne . They sat side by side , holding each other 's hands . They were staring straight at him . “ Yes , ” he said , “ what are you ? Who are you there ? ” Peering in , he saw that they were the bodies of a king and queen who had been buried there in that mountain tomb , perhaps centuries before the Spaniards came . He crept into the tomb to look at them . Once the door of a slab of stone had been mortared flush with the face of the crag , but it had fallen like most of the road that led to it . The mummies sat side by side , holding each other 's hands . Masks of gold still covered their faces . The masks had , no doubt , been modelled on the dead faces and preserved likenesses of that king and queen . Both were tiny ; they looked like children to Sard . They were the rulers who had driven men up the mountain to make that road . All about the walls were paintings of the lives of those two	                                                         
most imperishable pages ! So why should he not tell ? He was in her room one evening , and his arms were about her , and she had almost but not quite yielded . “ Please , please , Peter , ” she pleaded , “ stop being one of those horrid Reds ! ” And Peter could stand it no longer . He told her that he really was n't a Red , but a secret agent employed by the very biggest business men of American City to keep track of the Reds and bring their activities to naught . And when he told this , Rosie stared at him in consternation . She refused to believe him ; when he insisted , she laughed at him , and finally became angry . It was a silly yarn , and did he imagine he could string her along like that ? So Peter , irritated , set out to convince her . He told her about Guffey and the American City Land & Investment Company ; he told her about McGivney , and how he met McGivney regularly at Room 427 of the American House . He told her about his thirty dollars a week , and how it was soon to be increased to forty , and he would spend it all on her . And perhaps she might pretend to be converted by him , and become a Red also , and if she could satisfy McGivney that she was straight , he would pay her too , and it would be a lot better than working ten and a half hours a day in Isaac & Goldstein 's paper box factory . At last Peter succeeded in convincing the girl . She was subdued and frightened ; she had n't been prepared for anything like that , she said , and would have to have a little time to think it over . Peter then became worried in turn . He hoped she would n't mind , he said , and set to work to explain to her how important his work was , how it had the sanction of all the very best people in the city -- not merely the great bankers and business men , but mayors and public officials and newspaper editors and college presidents , and great Park Avenue clergymen like the Rev. de Willoughby Stotterbridge of the Church of the Divine Compassion . And Rosie said that was all right , of course , but she was a little scared and would have to think it over . She brought the evening to an abrupt end , and Peter went home much disconcerted . Perhaps an hour later there came a sharp tap on the door of his lodging - house room , and he went to the door , and found himself confronted by David Andrews , the lawyer , Donald Gordon , and John Durand , the	                                                          
Though she had now known New York for many years , there were phases of its theatrical life that still puzzled Kim 's mother , Magnolia Ravenal ; and this was one of them . “ The critics all seem to write plays , ” she complained . “ It makes the life of a successful actress like Kim so complicated . And the actors and actresses all lecture on the Trend of the Modern Drama at League Luncheons given at the Astor . I went to one once , with Kim . Blue voile ladies from Englewood . In my day critics criticized and actors acted . ” Her suave and gifted son - in - law , Kenneth Cameron , himself a producer of plays of the more precious pattern ( The Road to Sunrise , 1921 ; Jock o ' Dreams , 1924 ) , teased her gently about this attitude of intolerance . “ Why , Nola ! And you a famous stage mama ! You ought to know that even Kim occasionally has to do things for publicity . ” “ In my _ Cotton Blossom _ days we were more subtle . The band marched down Main Street and played on the corner and Papa gave out handbills . That was our publicity . I did n't have to turn handsprings up the levee . ” There was little that the public did not know about Kim Ravenal . There was nothing that the cagey young assistant critic did not know . He now assumed a tone of deep bitterness . “ All right , my fine lady . I 'll go back and write a pattern piece . Started in stock in Chicago . Went to New York National Theatre School . Star pupil and Teacher 's Pet while there . Got a bit in — uh — Mufti , was n't it?—and walked away with the play just like the aspiring young actress in a bum short story . Born on a show boat in Kentucky and Illinois and Missouri simultaneously — say , explain that to me some time , will you?—hence name of Kim . Also mother was a show - boat actress and later famous singer of coon — — Say , where is your mother these days , anyway ? Gosh , I think she 's grand ! I 'm stuck on her . She 's the burning passion of my youth . No kidding . I do n't know . She 's got that kind of haunted hungry et - up look , like Bernhardt or Duse or one of them . You 've got a little of it , yourself . ” “ Oh , sir ! ” murmured Kim , gratefully . “ Cultivate it , is my advice . And when she smiles ! . . . Boy ! I work like a dawg to get her to smile whenever I see her .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
'm running ? A bawdy - boat ? . . . Oh , language be damned ! . . . Now , Parthy , you 've got this far , do n't start all over again . . . . There she is ! Ai n't she pretty ! Look , Magnolia ! That 's where you 're going to live . . . . Oh , all right , all right ! I was just talking . . . The _ Cotton Blossom _ lay moored to great stobs . Long , and wide and plump and comfortable she looked , like a rambling house that had taken perversely to the nautical life and now lay at ease on the river 's broad breast . She had had two coats of white paint with green trimmings ; and not the least of these green trimmings comprised letters , a foot high , that smote Parthy 's anguished eye , causing her to groan , and Magnolia 's delighted gaze , causing her to squeal . There it was in all the finality of painter 's print : CAPT . ANDY HAWKS COTTON BLOSSOM FLOATING PALACE THEATRE Parthy gathered her dolman more tightly about her , as though smitten by a chill . The clay banks of the levee were strewn with cinders and ashes for a foothold . The steep sides of a river bank down which they would scramble and up which they would clamber were to be the home path for these three in the years to come . An awninged upper deck , like a cosy veranda , gave the great flatboat a curiously homelike look . On the main deck , too , the gangplank ended in a forward deck which was like a comfortable front porch . Pillars , adorned with scroll - work , supported this . And there , its mouth open in a half - oval of welcome , was the ticket window through which could be seen the little box office with its desk and chair and its wall rack for tickets . There actually were tickets stuck in this , purple and red and blue . Parthy shut her eyes as at a leprous sight . A wide doorway led into the entrance hall . There again double doors opened to reveal a stairway . “ Balcony stairs , ” Andy explained , “ and upper boxes . Seat hundred and fifty to two hundred , easy . Niggers mostly , upstairs , of course . ” Parthy shuddered . An aisle to the right , an aisle to the left of this stairway , and there was the auditorium of the theatre itself , with its rows of seats and its orchestra pit ; its stage , its boxes , its painted curtain raised part way so that you saw only the lower half of the Venetian water scene it depicted ; the legs of gondoliers in wooden	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
which he tried to hide , the man addressed the crowd : “ So , it 's us you want to get at ... must have us dance it you again , eh ? ... well , well , off we go . ” Cigarette stuck between his lips , cap cocked over one ear , the apache gripped Ernestine by the nape of the neck , whirled the girl round , and round again , to bring her facing him , then ordered her roughly : “ Go ahead , wench ; give it 'em , I say ! ” At this Bougille struck up the tune , and the couple began their evolutions . At first it was a slow waltz , with no precise rhythm , but dubious attitudes , languishing poses , embraces suggestive of passionate abandonment . Then , with a sudden brutality , the man hurled his partner away from him , caught her by the shoulders , threw her to the ground , then passing his arm under her supple waist , raised her to her feet , then lifted her up against his breast ; then , three times in succession , while “ Big Ernestine ” lay passive , “ The Beadle , ” striking an attitude half Hercules , half acrobat , whirled the woman about in his arms and beat her head on the earth . A thunder of applause broke out on every side . For sure there was not another pair to match “ The Beadle ” and “ Big Ernestine ” at dancing the _ Sonneuse _ . And what a dance it was , where the cavalier had to mimic the act of breaking his partner 's skull against the ground as apaches beat to death peaceable citizens against the curb of the sidewalk . It was fine , it was magnificent , the crowd was thrilled , electrified , and a young blackguard , “ Beauty Boy ” by nickname , caught by the wave of hot enthusiasm that stirred the passions of them all , seized the opportunity to give a bite at the nape of Nini 's neck , who cuffed him soundly for his pains . “ Look where you 're going , you idiot ! ” roared a furious voice as “ Beauty Boy ” fell foul of a shabby individual in his flight to escape the offended Nini 's vengeance . It was no other than M. Moche . What could the old fellow be doing there ? He was dirtier , shabbier , and more bent than ever ; at sight of him , Fandor was filled with alarm , but at the same time it struck him that Moche 's presence might prove useful to him . Yes , undoubtedly , it was a piece of good luck to find the old man had come to the _ Blue Chestnut _ . Assuredly , under pretext of	, ” he said , “ eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , 
that there was not room for two cars to pass , and I wondered at times if I could keep on it . Not only that , but it suddenly started to sweep around abrupt heights , in sharp , sudden curves — curves which took all one 's skill to make . It was with a little sigh of relief that I came off the mountain and began to follow the road which ran through two rows of trees . Suddenly we came out of the wood , to find ourselves by the shore of a small lake — a lake which formed almost a complete glimmering circle , with trees coming down to the water 's edge . The road followed the shore of the lake for a few hundred yards , then took an abrupt bend , to again come back to the water . And then , as we came around the bend , I saw three small buildings ahead of us — buildings placed in a cleared spot of ground , and with a little wharf in front which ran into the lake . And it was here we stopped . The buildings were the sort of summer cottages that one finds so often , built more for cheapness than for looks or even comfort . But when we climbed out of the car and went across the high grass , we found that there was no one at home . The cottages were occupied , for the doors were not locked . Hammocks were swung under the trees , and on the verandas were chairs with magazines flung upon them . But there was no one at home ; and when we went down to the wharf , we found the boats were not in . Evidently we would have to wait until they returned . We seated ourselves upon the edge of the wharf and let our legs dangle over the water . Lighting my cigar as the chief lighted his pipe , I gazed at the scene before . On all sides the woods circled the lake , the trees green and restful to the eyes . Above in a blue sky little fleecy clouds floated by , only to be reflected in the darker blue of the lake . And on every side were the hills , with the lake below , like the bottom to a cup . For a while we sat there , and the chief told me the camp was run by one of the churches in the village . But after a time conversation ceased , and we sat and smoked , dreaming in the sunlight . Once in a while a fish would jump from the water — a gleaming mass of silver — and fall back with a splash ; then would come the scream of a bird far down the lake . But save for these , the air was very still .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Call , ” who has been conducting an investigation into this case , has recently written to the author : “ Altogether , it is the most amazing story I have ever had anything to do with . When all is known that I think can be known , it will be shown clearly that the State before an open - eyed community was able to murder a man with the instruments that the people have provided for bringing about justice . There is n't a scrap of testimony in either of the Mooney or Billings cases that was n't perjured , except that of the man who drew the blue prints of Market Street . ” To what extent has the detection and punishment of radicalism in America passed out of the hands of public authorities and into the hands of “ Big Business ? ” Any business man will of course agree that when “ Big Business ” has interests to protect , it must and will protect them . So far as possible it will make use of the public authorities ; but when thru corruption or fear of politics these fail , “ Big Business ” has to act for itself . In the Colorado coal strike the coal companies raised the money to pay the state militia , and recruited new companies of militia from their private detectives . The Reds called this “ Government by Gunmen , ” and the writer in his muckraking days wrote a novel about it , “ King Coal . ” The man who directed the militia during this coal strike was A. C. Felts of the Baldwin - Felts Detective Agency , who was killed just the other day while governing several coal counties in West Virginia . You will find this condition in the lumber country of Washington and Oregon , in the oil country of Oklahoma and Kansas , in the copper country of Michigan , Montana and Arizona , and in all the big coal districts . In the steel country of Western Pennsylvania you will find that all the local authorities are officials of the steel companies . If you go to Bristol , R. I. , you will find that the National India Rubber Company has agreed to pay the salaries of two - thirds of the town 's police force . In every large city in America the employers ' associations have raised funds to hold down the unions and smash the Reds , and these funds are being expended in the way portrayed in “ 100 % . ” In Los Angeles the employers ' association raised a million dollars , and the result was the case of Sydney R. Flowers , briefly sketched in this story under the name of “ Sydney . ” The reader who wishes the details of this case is referred to Chapter LXVI of “ The Brass Cheek . ” Flowers has been twice tried	” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ”

The flat spring which trails on the street between the two rear wheels must make continuous contact with the metallic ' ground , ' else the current can not flow . """""""" """""""" But where does the current come from ? """""""" asked the girl . """""""" You have perhaps noticed already the white slender posts at the edge of the sidewalk , and on their tops umbrella - like insulators which carry a thick spiked wire . This wire , as you see , is about fifteen feet above the curb and carries the high frequency current which not only supplies our coasters with power , by way of our needle collectors , but also propels all the vehicles which you see gliding so noiselessly . """""""" They were well under way and rolled along at a speed of about twenty miles an hour . They passed thousands of citizens , all coasting at high speed . There was no noise but the peculiar hum produced by the thousands of motors , a sound which was in nowise annoying . Each sidewalk was divided in two parts . On the outside only people going in one direction , on the inside only people going in the opposite direction could coast . Collisions , therefore , were impossible . If a person rolling on the outside wished to enter a store , it was necessary to go to the end of the block , and then turn to the left , which brought him on the inside of the sidewalk where he could roll up to his destination . Of course , this was only necessary when the sidewalk was crowded , nothing preventing one 's crossing it if but few people were on the block . The trolley car had long since become obsolete as well as the gasoline - driven automobile . Only electromobiles carrying either passengers or freight were to be seen . Each vehicle was equipped with a short collector mast by means of which the electrical energy was conveyed to the motors . The wheels of all vehicles were rubber - covered . This accomplished two purposes : one to insulate the vehicle from the metallic street , the other to minimize the noise to the greatest extent .

The big man sighed and looked into the fire . “ Been thinking of the Spaniard ? ” he asked half between his teeth . “ No , ” said Sue so vehemently that he jumped . “ I have not , nor am like to . ” French smiled on her . “ Well , that 's all right , then , ai n't it ? ” he said cheerfully . “ I do n't know what you 're talking about , ” she said stiffly . French 's smile faded . “ No , that 's right , ” he said almost mournfully , “ that 's right . ” And there was silence for a few moments . He drank his rum , and after opening and shutting his mouth once or twice , rose to go . Sue watched him to the door and then in spite of herself the tears began to trickle down the side of her nose , and she sobbed once audibly . French was at her side in a moment . “ What is the matter , lassie ? ” he said kindly , all his shyness vanishing as he whipped out a large yellow handkerchief and began to wipe her eyes hastily . “ Are you ill ? ” Sue sobbed violently . “ No , ” she said angrily , and then snatching the handkerchief out of his hand buried her face in it . French put a big hand on each of her shoulders and shook her gently . “ If I asked you for something would you give it to me ? ” he said . Sue still covered her face with her hands . “ Oh ! why do n't you ask me ? ” she sobbed . French lifted her up in his arms to kiss her , and she stopped crying and began to blush as he carried her over to the chimney corner where they sat , laughing and whispering , till Gilbot and Red , driven in by the rain , which had restarted with as much violence as ever , came for their tea . “ I thought you watched that damned Spaniard a deal too much , sweetheart , ” said French , as he and Sue walked to the end of the lane together , although the rain came down in torrents . “ Oh ! go along with you .

Paulet , hers Nini . The pair had set up house together in the Rue Saint - Fargeau after their union one Easter eve in the tenderest , but unconsecrated bonds of love . The two had known each other from childhood . Paulet was the son of a worthy woman who kept the porter 's lodge at a big house in the Rue de la Goutte - d'Or . Nini lived in the same house , whither she had come as quite a child with her mother , a respectable working woman , Mme . Guinon by name , widow of an employé on the railway . Nini was the youngest of a large family ; they had been five brothers and sisters , but two having died at an early age , Mme . Guinon had only three surviving children . The two elder , Firmaine and Alfred , were in regular employment , the former at a mantua - maker 's in the Rue de la Paix , the latter with a bookbinder in the Rue des Grands - Augustins ; but Nini , a child of an uncontrolled and capricious temper and a venturesome and vicious disposition , could never acquire the habit of regular work , no matter how light . Instead of going apprentice , the girl had preferred to run the streets in company with the most outrageous young scamps , boys and girls , of the _ quartier _ . This was the very thing to attract and fascinate Paulet , the concierge 's son , who , too , as the phrase goes , had a wild “ bee in his bonnet , ” and who from his teens upwards had been over and over again told by the flash girls of La Chapelle that he was far too pretty a lad ever to do any work . For all that , Paulet was scarcely to be styled an Adonis ; slenderly built and under the middle height , he had into the bargain a pasty complexion , colourless hair and a pair of pale , watery eyes . Still , the features were well cut , almost refined . It was a common saying in the Rue de la Goutte - d'Or that for sure his mother must have gone wrong one day with a man of quality to have brought such a piece of goods into the world . In a word , Paulet was the women 's darling , because not only had the lad pretty manners of his own , but an inexhaustible fund of high spirits and an amazing gift of the gab — a typical “ ladies ' man ” in all the abomination of the term ... and in all its beauty ! The whole La Chapelle quarter was stirred to its depths when Paulet seduced little Nini Guinon , and had there and then resolved to set up house with the girl .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
where she had been crouching ever since . “ And for me , ” she vociferated in her screaming voice , “ why do n't they question me ? ask me what I 'm good for ? Well , I 'm going to tell you , whether or no . Hear me , Fantômas , and you , mates , too . The man who lies rotting there , down there in the fat , damp earth , the man who lies rotting there , bone naked , uncoffined , well , that 's my work , mine ! Fantômas , ” she persisted , “ it was me did the hardest job of all . By Père Moche 's orders , I sought out this man on the open sea aboard the liner _ La Lorraine _ . I boarded the big ship when the tug brought out her pilot to them ; slipping on deck when no one was looking , I crept down to the fellow 's cabin . I had no weapon , and I was only an old woman against a man in the prime of life . Well , I was a match for him all the same ; I sprang at his face , and with my bare teeth I tore out his throat ! To stop his blood fouling the carpet , I licked it up with my tongue . The man fell dead without a cry . Then I sewed him up in a big sack , and when we got near port , I pitched him into the water . Next night , with Père Moche to help , we fished up the body , poking about with a long pole in the mud at bottom of the dock - basin . And for three days did I cart the carrion about , till I buried it with my own hands under the flags in this cave here ! That 's what I did , Fantômas , I , a poor old woman ; say , have I the guts , am I brave , or am I not ? ” Without the quiver of a muscle , Juve had listened to the appalling confession of the hideous virago . “ This dead man , ” he asked in a low , broken voice , “ who was he ? ” But suddenly there rose an urgent cry of “ Hush ! hush ! ” The apaches had heard unusual sounds , the tramp of footsteps in the distance . By the wan , feeble light that filtered in through a grated opening on a level with the ground outside , the crowd could see one another 's repulsive faces drawn with anxiety . Already half suppressed vows of vengeance began to be heard . Fandor was terrified ; what was to happen next ? Was Juve , after escaping the gravest of his dangers , finally to fall a	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
, honourable signor , if I trouble you to wait a few moments , but there is a lady in my office , a very important client ; I must conclude my business with her . By your leave ... ” Moche , with another low bow , awaited the reply . “ Get done , and be quick about it ! ” was the rough answer . The old brigand went back immediately to the office , where Nini was still waiting ; she had never budged . Moche approached her with an air of triumph , calling softly : “ Come here , little girl ! ” and on her obeying , drew her to the window , setting her with her face to the full light . With his coarse , hairy hands the old usurer lifted the child 's touzled locks , parted them on her forehead and imprisoned the tangled curls in his palm . Nini let him do as he liked , puzzled and uncomprehending . “ D'you know , ” declared the old man , “ d'you know , with your hair down like a little girlie , you look ever so young . ” “ But , ” protested Nini , “ I 'm not old ; I 'm barely sixteen and a half . ” “ I daresay , ” resumed the other , “ and when you do n't put on your naughty look and have n't been drinking , you might verily be taken for a little saint . Now let 's see your hands . ” Again Nini did as she was bid , and Moche spreading out the fingers on his fore - arm , examined the nails . “ Quite good , again , ” he announced , “ carefully enough kept for a poor man 's child , and not too well kept neither , to make them think it 's a ‘ gay woman 's ' hand . ” Next moment , taking the girl by the shoulders , he gazed fixedly into her face with the air of one inspired . “ Nini , ” he cried , “ I have a brilliant idea , and if only you 're not too clumsy , we 're going , you and I , to do something mighty smart . Nini , next door there I 've got a ripe pear , it 's up to you to pluck it ; only , listen to me , I give you ten minutes to rig yourself out — not , mind you , like a street wench , but like an innocent little maid ; leave your hair down , do n't wear a hat , put on your plainest frock , drop your eyes , look sweet and modest , and think of what you were a year ago , a good little virtuous girl , living with her mother and just done learning up	, ” cried Moche , “ n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , n't , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ n't , Nini , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't do n't , ” he said .
if you and Mrs. Hawks and Miss Magnolia here would do me the honour to dine with me ashore this evening , and go to the theatre . I know a little French restaurant — — ” “ Papa ! ” She swooped down upon little Andy then , enveloping him in her ruffles , in her surah silk , her rose velvet , her perfume . Her arms were about his neck . Her fresh young cheek pressed the top of his grizzled head . Her eyes were enormous — and they looked into Ravenal 's eyes . “ Papa ! ” But years of contact with the prim Parthy had taught him caution . “ Your ma — — ” he began , feebly . Magnolia deserted him , flew to Ravenal , clutched his arm . Her lovely eyes held tears . Involuntarily his free hand covered her hand that clung so appealingly to his sleeve . “ He promised me . And now , because he 's got all that money to count because Doc was delayed at Baton Rouge and did n't meet us here like he expected he would this afternoon and Mama 's gone ashore and we were to drive to Lake Pontchartrain and have dinner and he has n't even changed his clothes and it 's almost four o'clock — probably is four by now — and he keeps counting that old money — — ” “ Magnolia ! ” shouted Andy in a French frenzy , clutching the whiskers as though to raise himself by them from the floor . Magnolia must have been enjoying the situation . Here were two men , both of whom adored her , and she them . She therefore set about testing their love . Her expression became tragic — but not so tragic as to mar her delightful appearance . To the one who loved her most deeply and unselfishly she said : “ You do n't care anything about me or my happiness . It 's all this old boat , and business , and money . Have n't I worked , night after night , year in , year out ! And now , when I have a chance to enjoy myself — it is n't as if you had n't promised me — — ” “ We 're going , I tell you , Nollie . But your ma is n't even here . And how did I know Doc was going to be stuck at Baton Rouge ! We got plenty of time to have dinner ashore and go to the theatre , but we 'll have to give up the drive to Pontchartrain — — ” A heartbroken wail from Magnolia .

She looked up to find the eyes of the tall stranger on her . A gaunt , long - limbed man , his clothes hung on his arms and legs as if they were the wooden limbs of a scarecrow . The shreds were knotted and tied together , and showed bare , shrunken shanks and shins , burnt and cut about , the dark hair of virility thick on them . His face , lean and leathern , had a curious expression of hunger . The eyes in it held dark memories , yet a glitter of the sun . Mary Cameron vaguely realised that she had known what manner of man this was the moment she looked into his eyes . That was why she had not been afraid when he confronted her on the doorstep ; why , too , she had been able to ask him into her house and treat him as an unexpected , but not unwelcome guest . The man on the bed moaned . Suddenly he started up with a shrill scream . """""""" A wave ! A wave ! We 'll be swamped . """""""" His voice fell away , muttering .

Then the fog went as though by magic and it was daylight . We could see everything when it was too late , Cape Caliente , Port Matoche , and all the coast as far as the Cow and Calves . We were on the Snappers , seven miles west of Caliente . Mr. Dorney had been thinking that we were among the Chamuceras , thirteen miles east of her . “ Well , sir , we could take stock of how we were . She was lying over on her starboard side a little and about a foot or two by the stern . We judged that she was ripped pretty well open , for the water was over her ' tween decks . And now that it was too late the wind began to freshen and she began to grind where she lay . Mr. Dorney furled the sails to ease her and got the boats ready for hoisting out , and by the time the boats were ready she was grinding down at each swell with a noise like ice cracking on a lake , and the sea all round her began to come up in a kind of syrup from our sugar . “ By eight o'clock it was no joke to be on deck . She was pounding and breaking the sea . Mr. Dorney decided to abandon ship . He hoisted all her colours first , house flag , ensign and number , and then he got off three of the boats . I went in the bo'sun 's boat . Just before Mr. Dorney 's boat was put over the side , while we were lying off watching , there came a great big swell , which passed underneath us , of course , but it caught the old _ Pathfinder _ fair and gave her a great yank over and everything in her seemed to fetch away over to starboard with a bang , and the next swell went right over her all along . It was just all they could do to get that last boat over . “ Well , that was the end of it , sir , we 'd a bit of a job to make Port Matoche , for the wind freshened into one of those local northerly gales which they call Arnottos . But we landed everybody and we took the sick up to the hospital . Mr. Hopkins and the A.B. were both much better when we left Port Matoche . The padre , Father Garsinton , was quite recovered . He came on here in a coaster so as to save a day while we were waiting for the mail . The doctor said that we had got some tropical infection on board , he did n't know quite what ; he said it was like medellin throat , but he had never known cases fatal before .

fresh air , outside the Circo , Captain Cary hailed a caleche . “ We 're well out of that , ” he said . “ I understood that it would be a display of athletics , but it was a very low piece of blackguardism : I call it degrading . ” “ Sir , ” Sard said , as they settled into their caleche , “ you perhaps noticed the two men in front of us . They were talking in Spanish of raiding a Mr. Kingsborough to - night , with a gang , in order to kidnap a woman . ” “ Kingsborough ? I do not know the name . ” “ He must be English or American , with that name , sir : and they talked as if they meant to do it . ” “ Kingsborough ? I suppose they were these liquor - smugglers , going to punish one of their gang ? ” “ No , sir : they called him _ Mr. _ Kingsborough , as though he were outside their gang . I wondered , sir , if you would mind enquiring at the Club , where Mr. Kingsborough lives , so that we could give him a warning . ” “ I do n't know that I want to be mixed up in the business , Mr. Harker . But you say they mean to kidnap a woman ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ It is n't a very easy thing to do , in a fine modern town like Las Palomas . ” “ They talked as though it would be easy to them , sir . ” “ I fail to see how it can be easy , Mr. Harker . I should not like to have to try it , even with all hands . However , what is the time ? ” “ Twenty minutes to five , sir . ” “ The tug will be alongside in an hour , and we are n't hove short yet . What 's more : I do n't like the look of that sky at all . ” “ No , sir . ” “ Still , we ought to do what we can . We will just ask at the Club , if this person should be known . But it would be wiser , I should have thought , to go direct to the police . ” “ Sir , if these people are liquor - smugglers , the chances are that they have bribed the police , or have an arrangement with them . ” “ That is so . There was a man at the Club the other night who said openly that when he settled here , he asked how he could stock his cellar .

not in any way to be distinguished from the born rulers of the country , coming forward on the platform and uttering the most treasonable sentences , denouncing the government , denouncing the blockade against Russia , praising the Bolshevik government of Russia , declaring that the people who went away in the “ Soviet Ark ” were fortunate , because they were escaping from a land of tyranny into a land of freedom . At every few sentences the orator would be stopped by a storm of applause that broke from the audience . And what was a poor Irish Catholic police detective to make of a proposition like that ? Here stood an orator declaring : “ Whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . ” And Garrity turned to Peter . “ What do you think of that ? ” he said , his good - natured Irish face blank with dismay . Peter thought it was the limit . Peter knew that thousands of men all over America had been sent to prison for saying things less dangerous than that . Peter had read many sets of instructions from the office of the Attorney - General of the United States , and knew officially that that was precisely the thing you were never under any circumstances permitted to say , or to write , or even to think . So Peter said to Garrity : “ That fellow 's gone far enough . You better arrest him . ” Garrity spoke to his men , and they sprang forward on the platform , and stopped the orator and placed him and all his fellow - orators under arrest , and ordered the audience out of the building . There were a couple of hundred policemen and detectives on hand to carry out Garrity 's commands , and they formed a line with their clubs , and drove the crowd before them , and carted the speakers off in a patrol wagon . Then Peter went back to Guffey 's office , and told what he had done -- and got a reception that reminded him of the time Guffey had confronted him with the letter from Nell Doolin ! “ Who do you think that was you pinched ? ” cried Guffey . “ He 's the brother of a United States senator ! And what do you think he was saying ? That was a sentence from the Declaration of Independence ! ” Peter could n't “ get it ” ; Peter was utterly lost .

Ah , De Medici blood . Centuries pass and it still flows unchanged in me . Yes , why not admit it ? Something exulted in me at the sight of the room , the dim lights , the murdered man . There was no fear , no nervousness . But a strange feeling of familiarity . And then a revulsion . I routed the exulting De Medici phantoms . And now what ? Trouble . A telephone call . She 'll tell lies . Her face is already a lie . Stern , poised , ready to fight for something .... What a woman ! Yes , I 'm more in love than before . Her eyes are like a shrine for something in me . They overpower me . My mind evaporates . ” De Medici reached suddenly for her hand . “ Florence , ” he whispered , “ remember ... regardless of anything — I adore you . ” Fifteen minutes had passed and Lieutenant Norton appeared . “ I 'd like to see you , ” he said , nodding at De Medici . He followed the detective into the room . For a second time the amazingly disordered room confronted him . “ I 've made a hasty examination , ” Norton began . “ I 've also sent for Dr. Greer , the physician for our squad . He 'll be here shortly . In the meantime we can talk over a few things . When did this happen ? I mean exactly . Do you know ? ” The eyes of the detective rested on De Medici 's stained fingers as he spoke . De Medici held his hand to the light . “ Hardly evidence , ” he answered the man 's unspoken question . “ I got that on my fingers when I kneeled over the body to look at the wound . ” Norton nodded . De Medici continued and repeated the scant information he had at his command — starting with the appearance of Florence Ballau in the vestibule of the apartment . “ Hm , ” muttered the detective . Then after a pause , “ I see . Nothing much . Did you notice what he has in his hand ? ” He pointed to the dead man and De Medici bent over the body . He stared with surprise . The fingers of Victor Ballau were clutched around a short , pointed false beard — a black Vandyke . “ It was a man , then , ” De Medici murmured . “ You thought it might have been a woman ? ” Norton asked quietly . De Medici shrugged his shoulders . The lieutenant appeared to forget his question and continued , “ There 's also this thing here . ” He indicated a heavy brass candlestick whose body was ornamented with carved salamander figures twining toward its mouth .

curious smile play over Bartley 's face . Slowly , he turned the pages of the book , and then to my surprise he placed it in his pocket . Then , turning to the girl , he asked : “ Now , did any one call the library on the telephone during the afternoon ? ” “ Two people , both men . I do not know who they were . Mr. Warren answered the phone . I do n't even know what they wanted . ” “ And do you know if Mr. Warren was expecting any visitor ? ” “ Not that I know of , ” was her response . “ In fact I doubt it very much . ” Though other questions were asked her , she knew nothing more of value . She did say the windows and the door were left open while they were working , but that Mr. Warren had them closed every evening . When she left the library the windows were all open and she could not account for any reason why they should be closed . Then , at our request , she went carefully over the room in an attempt to discover if anything had been disturbed . But when she had finished , she was forced to admit that nothing had been touched . For a moment after she made this statement we stood silent , wondering just what our next move could be ; and then came Bartley 's voice : “ Miss Harlan , where did Mr. Warren keep his manuscript and the notes of his trip to China ? ” She pointed to the large safe which stood near the door . As Bartley went over to look at it , I followed him . It was a rather large safe and , as I expected , it was locked . Bartley stood looking at it a moment , only to turn when the girl said : “ I know the combination , Mr. Bartley . Mr. Warren had me lock it every night . Also open it at times . He always used the same combination . ” At the chief 's suggestion she came over to the safe and , bending down , fumbled for a moment or so with the lock . The first time she tried she did not get the right combination , but the next trial resulted in the door being opened . The interior of the safe was of the usual type , save for the fact that there seemed far more space than is usual . This open space at the lower half was filled with a mass of papers which no one disturbed . At Bartley 's request after his short examination she closed the safe , giving him the combination which he wrote down in a little red note book . We slowly returned to the center of the room , no one	Bartley sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er .

It 's silly for a great big grown - up person like you that 's a million years old . ” Andy was absent from home all day long , and often late into the night . The _ Cotton Blossom _ was being overhauled from keel to pilot house . She was lying just below the landing ; painters and carpenters were making her shipshape . Andy trotted up and down the town and the river bank , talking , gesticulating , capering excitedly . There were numberless supplies to be ordered ; a troupe to be assembled . He was never without a slip of paper on which he figured constantly . His pockets and the lining of his cap bristled with these paper scraps . One week following their quarrel Parthy Ann began to evidence interest in these negotiations . She demanded details . How much had he paid for that old mass of kindling wood ? ( meaning , of course , the _ Cotton Blossom _ ) . How many would its theatre seat ? What did the troupe number ? What was their route ? How many deck - hands ? One cook or two ? Interspersed with these questions were grumblings and dire predictions anent money thrown away ; poverty in old age ; the advisability of a keeper being appointed for people whose minds had palpably given way . Still , her curiosity was obviously intense . “ Tell you what , ” suggested Andy with what he fancied to be infinite craft . “ Get your hat on come on down and take a look at her . ” “ Never , ” said Parthenia ; and untied her kitchen apron . “ Well , then , let Magnolia go down and see her .

Parthy remained grim . Yet she must have been immediately disturbed , for Magnolia wept so seldom as to be considered a queer child on this count , among many others . “ Hush your noise , ” commanded Parthy . Great sobs racked Magnolia . Andy crudely followed up his advantage . “ I guess you 'll forget how your papa looks time he gets back . ” Magnolia , perfectly	” Suddenly , he commanded a tack , and he commanded a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a tack , a .

I am not sleepy ; I am burning with fever and I feel thirsty — oh ! so thirsty . ” The grand duchess carefully measured out a few drops of champagne into a glass , added a little water , and held out the cool , refreshing beverage : “ Drink , my poor darling . The doctor did not forbid this . ” A wan smile hovered on the patient 's lips , as she eagerly quenched her raging thirst . “ The doctor ! ” she murmured , “ why does the doctor worry me with his prescriptions ? He knows I shall not get well . ” But in a severe voice now , a tinge of bitterness even in its tones , the grand duchess replied : “ I do not wish you , Elisabeth , to talk like that . You have no right not to get well .... Think of him ! ” By what series of strange events came Elisabeth Dollon , for the injured woman was indeed Elisabeth Dollon , to be in this house , the house of the Grand Duchess Alexandra , to have that enigmatic personage for sick - nurse ? The pursuit of Fandor among the underwood of the Ile de Beauté , while the blazing lake was burning itself out , had ended in a startling tragedy , the discovery of Elisabeth wounded , shot by the police - officers , who had fired on her in the belief they were shooting at Fantômas . How had the mistake come about ? Alas ! it found its explanation in a terrible scene that had just passed between the Grand Duchess Alexandra and the unhappy girl the young journalist loved . When the first moments of stupefaction were over , and the officers of justice were hotly pursuing the fugitive , Elisabeth Dollon had confessed to the grand duchess in the stammering accents of terror , that it was really and truly the journalist Fandor she had seen and denounced under the name of Fantômas . Then the grand duchess had hesitated no more . She had come there to undeceive Elisabeth Dollon , to convince her of Fandor 's innocence , and now she carried out her intention with a vigour and emphasis born of her sympathy with the pair , and even as she spoke , she could see the girl turn pale and almost faint in her excitement . It was true then , Fandor was innocent ? Fandor was worthy of her love ! Fandor was the victim of a cruel Fate!—and it was she who had set the policemen on his track , the men who at that moment were ransacking the island to seize him , dead or alive ! In an instant the brave girl had resolved on a sublime act of self - sacrifice . Realizing that Fandor was done for if the pursuit continued , she made up	Fandor sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , er sah Elisabeth , Fandor .

To what extent has it been necessary to torture the Reds in prison in America ? Those who are interested are advised to write to Harry Weinberger , 32 Union Square , New York , for the pamphlet entitled “ Twenty Years Prison , ” dealing with the case of Mollie Steimer , and three others who were sentenced for distributing a leaflet protesting against the war on Russia ; also to the American Civil Liberties Union for the pamphlet entitled “ Political Prisoners in Federal Military Prisons , ” also the pamphlet , “ Uncle Sam : Jailer , ” by Winthrop D.

There may be some reader with a sense of humor who asks about the brother of a United States senator being arrested for reading a paragraph from the Declaration of Independence . This gentleman was the brother of United States Senator France of Maryland , and curiously enough , the arrest took place in the city of Philadelphia , where the Declaration of Independence was adopted . There may be some reader who is curious about a clergyman being indicted and arrested in Winnipeg for having quoted the prophet Isaiah . The paragraph from the indictment in question reads as follows : “ That J. S. Woodsworth , on or about the month of June , in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and nineteen , at the City of Winnipeg , in the Province of Manitoba , unlawfully and seditiously published seditious libels in the words and figures following : ` Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees , and that write grievousness which they have prescribed ; to turn aside the needy from judgment , and to take away their right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless . . . . And they shall build houses and inhabit them , and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them . They shall not build and another inhabit , they shall not plant and another eat ; for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .

She bailed and leg - roped the cows . Wondering why he had come , as she milked , and the milk fell with a gentle swish into the pail between her knees , she could not believe that it was merely to bring them the good news that Davey and the Schoolmaster were likely to get off . She turned the cows into the paddock beside the bails and took the pail of warm , sweet - smelling milk indoors . When she went into the kitchen McNab was sitting in the big chair by the fire . He looked up at her . The firelight showed his face and the smile that glimmered on it . He seemed to be remembering , and with triumph , that other night when he had sat there .

blue eyes belying the sable hirsuteness of villainy . Julie coached him patiently , tirelessly . The result was fairly satisfactory . But a nuance , an inflection , was beyond him . “ Who has a better right ! ” his line would be , perhaps . Schultzy , directing at rehearsal , would endeavour fruitlessly to convey to him its correct reading . After rehearsal , Julie could be heard going over the line again and again . “ Who has a better _ right _ ! ” Steve would thunder , dramatically . “ No , dear . The accent is on ‘ better . ' Like this : ‘ Who has a _ better _ right ! ' ” Steve 's blue eyes would be very earnest , his face red with effort . “ Oh , I see . Come down hard on ‘ better , ' huh ? ‘ Who has a better _ right _ ! ' ” It was useless . The two were very much in love . The others in the company sometimes teased them about this , but not often . Julie and Steve did not respond to this badinage gracefully . There existed between the two a relation that made the outsider almost uncomfortable . When they looked at each other , there vibrated between them a current that sent a little shiver through the beholder . Julie 's eyes were deep - set and really black , and there was about them a curious indefinable quality . Magnolia liked to look into their soft and mournful depths . Her own eyes were dark , but not like Julie 's . Perhaps it was the whites of Julie 's eyes that were different . Magnolia had once seen them kiss . She had come upon them quietly and unexpectedly , on deck , in the dusk . Certainly she had never witnessed a like passage of love between her parents ; and even her recent familiarity with stage romance had not prepared her for it . It was long before the day of the motion picture fade - out . Olga Nethersole 's famous osculation was yet to shock a Puritan America . Steve had held Julie a long long minute , wordlessly . Her slimness had seemed to melt into him . Julie 's eyes were closed . She was quite limp as he tipped her upright . She stood thus a moment , swaying , her eyes still shut . When she opened them they were clouded , misty , as were his . The two then beheld a staring and fascinated little girl quite palpably unable to move from the spot . Julie had laughed a little low laugh . She had not flushed , exactly . Her sallow colouring had taken on a tone at once deeper and clearer and brighter , like amber underlaid with gold . Her eyes had widened until they	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .
had no fear of him . He walked to within twenty yards of the tree and the hawk looked at him and cried . Presently it rose and circled round and sank away upon the wind , leaving Sard utterly alone . He drank of the water of the lake and pushed on up the hillside to a point where the cliff seemed scaleable . Here as he went he heard noises that made him think that multitudes of men were at work in the mountains near him . There were noises of footsteps and of voices , noises of tools beating upon metals , explosions and the rumblings of machines . It was now midday , and even at that season the sun had power to loosen stones from the cliff - face . Little stones were falling all round him with little rustling patters like stealthy footsteps . Sometimes a bigger stone would fall , bound for a few feet , and dislodge some other stone . Sometimes little trails of earth and stone came slithering down . Higher up on the great crags boulders fell at intervals , thundering like guns and sending echoes . It was like the laughter of demons . He reached the summit of the crag and saw beyond him another steep ascent leading to another wall of rock . This ascent was paved with rotten stone , into which his feet sank over the ankles at each step . It was rock made rotten by frost and sun , and it broke like clay under his feet . The sun burned upon his back as he walked , and wind from the icefields blew sand into his face . He persevered until he reached the cliff beyond , only to find that there was no climbing it . It rose up sheer and the point seemed to overhang . When he tried to scale part of it , the foothold and the hand - hold gave way beneath him . It was stone that had ceased to be stone . In the heat of the day he learnt that there was no pass there across the mountains . The man had misled him , to bring him into a desert from which there could be no escape . There was hardly any sign of life in all that wilderness , except a few evil - looking shrubs about a foot high , so armed with spines that they seemed all teeth . He had read somewhere that all things in the desert are deadly . These shrubs , the hawk , the asp basking in the sun , and the scorpion beneath the rock , were the only dwellers in that waste . He made up his mind that there was nothing for it but to go back over his tracks and start again at the pine trees . Evil as the men there were , he felt himself drawn towards them	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
attitudes ; faded blue lagoon ; palace steps . Magnolia knew a pang of disappointment . True , the boxes bore shiny brass railings and boasted red plush upholstered seats . “ But I thought it would be all light and glittery and like a fairy tale , ” she protested . “ At night , ” Andy assured her . He had her warm wriggling little fingers in his . “ At night . That 's when it 's like a fairy tale . When the lamps are lighted ; and all the people ; and the band playing . ” “ Where 's the kitchen ? ” demanded Mrs. Hawks . Andy leaped nimbly down into the orchestra pit , stooped , opened a little door under the stage , and beckoned . Ponderously Parthy followed . Magnolia scampered after . Dining room and cook 's galley were under the stage . Great cross - beams hung so low that even Andy was forced to stoop a little to avoid battering his head against them . Magnolia could touch them quite easily with her finger - tips . In time it came to seem quite natural to see the company and crew of the _ Cotton Blossom _ entering the dining room at meal time humbly bent as though in a preliminary attitude of grace before meat . There were two long tables , each accommodating perhaps ten ; and at the head of the room a smaller table for six . “ This is our table , ” Andy announced , boldly , as he indicated the third . Parthy snorted ; but it seemed to the sensitive Andy that in this snort there was just a shade less resentment than there might have been . Between dining room and kitchen an opening , the size of a window frame , had been cut in the wall , and the base of this was a broad shelf for convenience in conveying hot dishes from stove to table . As the three passed from dining room to kitchen , Andy tossed over his shoulder further information for the possible approval of the bristling Parthy . “ Jo and Queenie — she cooks and he waits and washes up and one thing another — they promised to be back April first , sure . Been with the _ Cotton Blossom _ , those two have , ten years and more . Painters been cluttering up here , and what not . And will you look at the way the kitchen looks , spite of 'em . Slick 's a whistle . Look at that stove ! ” Crafty Andy . Parthenia Ann Hawks looked at the stove . And what a stove it was ! Broad - bosomed , ample , vast , like a huge fertile black mammal whose breast would suckle numberless eager sprawling bubbling pots and pans . It shone richly .

Gordon , who was the son of a well - to - do business man , and had been to college , until he was expelled for taking the doctrines of Christianity too literally and expounding them too persistently on the college campus . There was a big , brawny lumber - jack from the North , Jim Henderson by name , who had been driven out of the camps for the same reason , and had appalling stories to tell of the cruelties and hardships of the life of a logger . There was a Swedish sailor by the name of Gus , who had visited every port in the world , and a young Jewish cigar - worker who had never been outside of American City , but had travelled even more widely in his mind . The sixth man was the strangest character of all to Peter ; a shy , dreamy fellow with eyes so full of pain and a face so altogether mournful that it hurt to look at him . Duggan was his name , and he was known in the movement as the “ hobo poet . ” He wrote verses , endless verses about the lives of society 's outcasts ; he would get himself a pencil and paper and sit off in the corner of the cell by the hour , and the rest of the fellows , respecting his work , would talk in whispers so as not to disturb him . He wrote all the time while the others slept , it seemed to Peter . He wrote verses about the adventures of his fellow - prisoners , and presently he was writing verses about the jailers , and about other prisoners in this part of the jail . He would have moods of inspiration , and would make up topical verses as he went along ; then again he would sink back into his despair , and say that life was hell , and making rhymes about it was childishness . There was no part of America that Tom Duggan had n't visited , no tragedy of the life of outcasts that he had n't seen . He was so saturated with it that he could n't think of anything else . He would tell about men who had perished of thirst in the desert , about miners sealed up for weeks in an exploded mine , about matchmakers poisoned until their teeth fell out , and their finger nails and even their eyes . Peter could see no excuse for such morbidness , such endless harping upon the horrible things of life . It spoiled all his happiness in the jail -- it was worse than little Jennie 's talking about the war !

the Hotel de Soto , and at the end of it the butler tapped softly upon a door , and Peter was ushered into a big apartment in semi - darkness . The butler retired without a sound , closing the door behind him and Peter stood hesitating , looking about to get his bearings . From the other side of the room he heard three faint coughs , suggesting a sick man . There was a four - poster bed of some dark wood , with a canopy over it and draperies at the side , and a man in the bed , sitting propped up with pillows . There were more coughs , and then a faint whisper , “ This way . ” So Peter crossed over and stood about ten feet from the bed , holding his hat in his hands ; he was not able to see very much of the occupant of the bed , nor was he sure it would be respectful for him to try to see . “ So you're--(cough ) what 's your name ? ” “ Gudge , ” said Peter . “ You are the man--(cough ) that knows about the Reds ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” The occupant of the bed coughed every two or three minutes thru the conversation that followed , and each time Peter noticed that he put his hand up to his mouth as if he were ashamed of the noise . Gradually Peter got used to the twilight , and could see that Nelse Ackerman was an old man with puffy , droopy cheeks and chin , and dark puffy crescents under his eyes . He was quite bald , and had on his head a skull cap of embroidered black silk , and a short , embroidered jacket over his night shirt . Beside the bed stood a table covered with glasses and bottles and pill - boxes , and also a telephone . Every few minutes this telephone would ring , and Peter would wait patiently while Mr. Ackerman settled some complex problem of business . “ I 've told them my terms , ” he would say with irritation , and then he would cough ; and Peter , who was sharply watching every detail of the conduct of the rich , noted that he was too polite even to cough into the telephone . “ If they will pay a hundred and twenty - five thousand dollars on account , I will wait , but not a cent less , ” Nelse Ackerman would say . And Peter , awe - stricken , realized that he had now reached the very top of Mount Olympus , he was at the highest point he could hope to reach until he went to heaven . The old man fixed his dark eyes on his visitor . “ Who wrote me that letter ? ” whispered the husky	Ackerman sat down on the bed , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down .
was the first to speak . He had just entered by a side door and apparently was entirely unimpressed by the Spaniard or any one else . “ Evening , ” he remarked , as he walked over to the most comfortable seat in the chimney - corner and sat down . “ Evening to you too , sir , ” he said , noticing Dick for the first time -- and then he added , peering out of the fireplace , “ Mistress Sue , a rum if you please . ” Black'erchief Dick , noting that the spell was broken , swaggered forward into the firelight . “ Greeting , friends , ” he said courteously , and then after looking round curiously his eyes rested on Gilbot . “ Is this mine host ? ” he asked . Gilbot 's eyes opened slowly and his jaw dropped as he saw for the first time the splendidly garbed figure . “ Eh ? ” he said at last . “ Washt ? ” He tried to rise but gave it up as an impossibility , his brow clouded , and he turned his tankard upside down on his knee . Dick stood looking at him , a slight smile hovering round his mouth and twitching the sides of his big Jewish nose . Gilbot 's face cleared as suddenly as it had clouded . “ Ashk Hal , ” he said triumphantly , and leaning back once more he closed his eyes . The Spaniard shrugged his shoulders . “ You mistress ? ” he said , turning to Sue who dropped a curtsey . “ Can I have a bedchamber here this night ? ” Sue replied that all was ready for him , and Dick , having assured himself that everything was to his liking , put his hand into his pocket and drawing out a handful of gold and silver coins tossed them lightly on the table . “ Drinks all round , I pray you , mistress , ” he said . There was a slight stir among the company , and the Spaniard was regarded with still more respect . Sue stood looking at the coins , her hands on her hips . “ ‘ Tis much too much , ” she murmured . Black'erchief Dick laughed . “ Marry ! Then , mistress , ' twill do for the next lot . I pray thee haste , my throat is parched , ” he said . Sue , her eyes round with admiration , curtseyed again and ran to the inner door . “ Anny , lass , come hither I prithee , ” she called , and then hastened to obey the Spaniard . Anny stepped in unnoticed a moment or two later , and busied herself with the tankards . Dick was sitting with his back toward her and she did not see him . “ Here , lass ,	, ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” he remarked , “ , ” , “ ” he swaggered , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” and he swagglowed his eyes , “ ” he said , “ ” and he sat down on the bedchamber .

to have meetings of the Communist Party and Communist Labor Party held on the night set . I have been informed by some of the bureau officers that such arrangements will be made . ” So much evidence of the activity of the provocateur was produced before Federal Judge G. W. Anderson that he declared as follows : “ What does appear beyond reasonable dispute is that the Government owns and operates some part of the Communist Party . ” It appears that Judge Anderson does not share the high opinion of the “ under cover ” operative set forth by the writer of “ 100 % . ” Says Judge Anderson : “ I can not adopt the contention that Government spies are any more trustworthy , or less disposed to make trouble in order to profit therefrom , than are spies in private industry . Except in time of war , when a Nathan Hale may be a spy , spies are always necessarily drawn from the unwholesome and untrustworthy classes . A right - minded man refuses such a job . The evil wrought by the spy system in industry has , for decades , been incalculable . Until it is eliminated , decent human relations can not exist between employers and employees , or even among employees . It destroys trust and confidence ; it kills human kindliness ; it propagates hate . ” To what extent have the governmental authorities of America been forced to deny to the Reds the civil rights guaranteed to good Americans by the laws and the constitution ?

striking terror to her was the Mississippi River . Surely she should have known . She had literally been born on that turbid torrent . All through her childhood her mother , Magnolia Ravenal , had told her tales of its vagaries , its cruelties , its moods ; of the towns along its banks ; of the people in those towns ; of the boats that moved upon it and the fantastic figures that went up and down in those boats . Her grandfather , Captain Andy Hawks , had lost his life in the treacherous swift current of its channel ; her grandmother , Parthenia Ann Hawks was , at eighty , a living legend of the Mississippi ; the Flying Dutchman of the rivers , except that the boat touched many ports . One heard strange tales about Hawks ' widow . She had gone on with the business after his tragic death . She was the richest show - boat owner on the rivers . She ran the boat like a female seminary . If an actor uttered so much as a damn , he was instantly dismissed from the troupe . Couples in the company had to show a marriage certificate . Every bill — even such innocuous old - timers as East Lynne and The Gambler 's Daughter and Tempest and Sunshine — were subject to a purifying process before the stern - visaged female owner of the new _ Cotton Blossom _ would sanction their performance on her show boat . Kim herself remembered many things about the Mississippi , though after her very early childhood she did not see it for many years ; and her mother rarely spoke of it . She even shook her head when Kim would ask her for the hundredth time to tell her the story of how she escaped being named Mississippi . “ Tell about the time the river got so high , and all kinds of things floated on it — animals and furniture and houses , even — and you were so scared , and I was born , and you wanted to call me Mississippi , but you were too sleepy or something to say it . And the place was near Kentucky and Illinois and Missouri , all at once , so they made up a name from the letters K and I and M , just till you could think of a real name . And you never did . And it stayed Kim . . . . People laugh when I tell them my name 's Kim . Other girls are named Ellen and Mary and Elizabeth . . . . Tell me about that time on the Mississippi .

CHAPTER VII THE HAUNTED ROOM In which an apoplectic scientist explodes — In which invisible footsteps sound in a dark corridor — In which Julien De Medici opens a letter — The woman of the hidden eyes — Floria , the lady of the dagger , appears — In which underworlds collide — The staircase to Hell and a strange passion — A voice that spoke over the telephone . Tall , wine - colored velvets fell in monotonous parallels from the ceiling to the floor . There were no windows to be seen . A somber and luxurious emptiness like the inside of a jewel box stamped the curious chamber . Four black candlesticks ending in little pyramids of flame stood on the long table in the center . The four little flames glistened like suspended medallions . The towering drapes that enclosed the room broke the darkness into thin and motionless waves . The shadows reaching toward the burning candles seemed to beat with an invisible and inaudible rhythm . Julien De Medici , his narrow eyes half shut , sat watching the dungeon lights that flitted over the face of Dr. Lytton . The doctor 's bald head loomed ghostlike above the table . His black eyes were peering wrathfully at his half visible host . He was talking in a voice alive with indignation . “ Bring some lights into this confounded place . This sort of thing is at the bottom of your trouble , Julien . ” He waved his short hand in the air and a great shadow lifted itself to the ceiling . “ You 're deliberately submitting yourself to a dangerous hypnosis . The wraiths of past De Medicis ! Inherited phantoms . Bosh ! ” The scientist snorted and brought a fist down on the table . “ Hypnosis , I tell you . A cleverly induced mania as artificial as this damned room . Wake up , man . There 's nothing wrong with you except a stupid,—yes , sir , a damnably deliberate effort to make a fool out of yourself . You 're as sound mentally as I am . ” “ Thanks . ” The soft voice of De Medici came out of the shadows . His choler growing , the doctor continued : “ Why do n't you try crystal - gazing ? Sitting in a room like this , candlesticks , darkness , drapes , and bombarding yourself with the fancy that you 're someone else ! What do you expect ? Something is bound to happen if you keep it up long enough . ” “ I am satisfied . ” The soft calm of De Medici 's voice seemed to infuriate his friend . “ And you claim to be in love with Florence , ” he cried . “ Yet you have n't made a move to help her . They 'll close in on her any day now . We	Medici schrie , warum er es nicht gemacht hat .

! De Medici glanced at the lieutenant . A clumsy ruse , perhaps , to throw someone off guard . Yet the man seemed simple . His voice contained an unmistakable ring of sincerity . Lieutenant Norton was talking again . “ Has that table usually been in this room ? ” he asked . He pointed to a walnut - topped card table standing beside the fireplace . De Medici shook his head . “ I never saw that before , ” he answered . “ It looks as if two people might have been sitting at that table preparing to eat , ” the detective smiled . De Medici noted the contents of the table top with surprise . It was a detail that had escaped him . There were two glasses and an opened wine bottle between them , several empty plates and a napkin . But he noticed neither cutlery nor sign of food . Norton rose as he studied this strange fact . “ Hello , doctor . ” A middle - aged , medical - looking man with a bald head had entered the room . Norton introduced him . “ Dr. Greer , ” he said . The doctor greeted De Medici with a nod and leaned over the body on the floor . His fingers felt around the imbedded dagger for a moment , and then slowly withdrew the weapon . He straightened , holding the dripping blade to the light . “ Through the heart , ” he commented briefly . “ Death was almost instantaneous . An odd sort of knife . ” “ We 'll call Miss Ballau , ” declared Norton . He gave a direction to his assistant who had remained silent and motionless near the wall . Florence arrived . De Medici , waiting nervously , his fists clenched on his knees , breathed deeply as she entered . Her vivid face was white . Her eyes were lowered . But behind the collapse of her manner De Medici sensed a tautness , a defiance . “ She 'll talk quietly , ” he thought , “ and tell nothing . Beautiful , how beautiful she is ! ” The detective had started his questioning . “ What time did you come home , Miss Ballau ? ” “ About half - past ten , ” she replied . “ You 're playing in ‘ The Dead Flower , ' are n't you ? ” She nodded . “ Then you must have left before the show was over . ” “ Yes , ” she said , “ I had a frightful headache .

The old man was even dirtier than usual , his hat crammed down over his ears — a huge topper , all dinted and dulled ; his brow was wrinkled in deep and serious thought . It was eleven in the forenoon when the usurer of the Rue Saint - Fargeau had taken up his position on the foot - bridge thrown across the narrow sluice - gates separating the basin of La Villette from the Canal de l'Ourcq and connecting the two sections of the Rue de Crimée . Heedless of anything passing about him , M. Moche looked down at the current , in which the man 's common , cunning features were reflected as in a mirror . But at the same time he kept ever and anon casting furtive glances towards the bottom of the street . At last the old fellow shook off his lethargy . From the far end of the Rue de Crimée he had caught sight of a man dressed in a long white blouse who was pushing before him a wheel - barrow loaded up with a workman 's tools . The barrow bumped up and down over the uneven pavement as the man advanced slowly along the road , for the load seemed a heavy one . Still , in course of time the modest vehicle reached the bridge . The workman let go the handles , mopped his brow — it was a blazing hot day — and then , after a glance round , he saw M. Moche and stepped up to him . It was plain enough the two had met by appointment , for they seemed in no way surprised at the _ rencontre _ . The pair began talking in low tones : “ You were waiting for me , M. Moche ? ” “ Why , yes , I was waiting for you , waiting without much hoping you 'd come ; still I waited . ” The workman mopped his forehead again , muttering in a weary voice : “ I 've had the devil 's own job of it this morning , I can tell you ! ” “ Poor fellow ! ” observed Moche , a note of ironical commiseration in his voice . Then the old business man went on : “ It 's uncommon seldom , all the same , one sees you sweating yourself ; when a man has a ‘ bee in his bonnet ' like you ... ” The workman laughed : “ Say a hiveful of 'em , Père Moche , and you 'll be nearer truth . God ! I ca n't deny it , hard work 's not my strong point	Moche sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es .
his eyes reluctantly from the burning logs , De Medici glanced at the darkness of the empty room . He studied the shadows with frightened eyes . He was a curious man of thirty . An aristocratic ugliness marked his face . The long , thin nose , the high cheek - bones , the wide , inanimate mouth and the green - tinted skin gave him a lithographic rather than human air . His black hair was cut in a straight line across his forehead . He wore it unparted in such a manner that it made an almost square frame for the elongated rigidity of his face . A striking and bizarre figure , poised , precise and seemingly of another world , he lived chiefly in his eyes . They were narrow and black , symmetrical to a point of artificiality . But under the parenthesis of the brows lived a startling man . From the carved chair before the burning logs , De Medici studied the shadows . He disliked darkness and empty rooms . Shadows frightened him . Opened doors chilled him . Yet his immobile face smiled derisively . “ Fear , ” he thought . “ It 's like a disease . ” He smiled again as if amused at the emotion disturbing him . “ Ghosts , ” he continued to himself . His eyes were on the opened door in the shadows at the end of the room . “ Ghosts walk around inside me . ” And he fell to thinking of an old subject — of the ghosts that prowled the mysterious corridors of his soul .... De Medici — ah , what a name ! A sarcophagus of evil .... He recalled with a shudder the excitement of the critics who had written about the opening of his play at Victor Ballau 's theater two weeks ago . One of them in particular had given him a bad hour . A discerning fellow .... He remembered the critic 's phrases : “ ... and now a De Medici turned dramatist . What a name to conjure with ! One needs no genealogical chart to assure one that here in Julien De Medici writing plays for Broadway is a descendant of those monstrous and evil adventurers whose villainies once illumined the courts of Europe .... ” De Medici smiled at the memory of the words .... A bit redundant and in the grand style affected by romantically hungry puritans writing for the press .... He continued recalling the review : “ For here again is the De Medici touch . Prince Julien , who witnessed the premier of his first drama—‘The Dead Flower'—is a gentleman of exemplary habits and enviable charm . But in this play to which he has signed his name lives again the sardonic evil which once made empire builders of his family . A dreadful humor pervades this amazing work . Its characters are etched	De Medici sah eloquently , as if he were a sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic sardonic .
finished what he was saying for his benefit . “ For my part , ” he declared , “ I consider the whole catastrophe had but one object — this theft ! It must have been done while the princess lay in a faint and Tom Bob had left her to help in saving life . Tom Bob , police - detective as he is , never saw the wood for the trees ! ” The _ attaché _ nodded : “ You are doubtless right , sir ; but who can have organized this daring , this audacious plot ? ” It was in a hushed voice , almost in a whisper , that the Ambassador made answer : “ Who ? Egad ! I think there is only one man in all the world ... and you know his name ! ” “ Fantômas ? ” “ Yes , Fantômas . ” Already on every lip the dread name was being repeated , the name of horror and of blood , the name that alone could make credible the incredible reality , that could make it seem possible , that could account for it . “ Fantômas ! Fantômas ! he and no other must have planned all this ! ” And through the night , more grim than ever the three tragic syllables re - echoed , spreading consternation — Fantômas ! CHAPTER XV IN A PRIVATE ROOM M. Moche was in a generous mood that morning . He now beckoned to the waiter of the drinking shop where he sat with a companion , the apache known by the nickname of the “ Gasman , ” and ordered a bottle of wine and glasses to be set on the table . But the old man had certainly not summoned this “ Gasman ” to meet him merely for the pleasure of standing the young ruffian a drink . For a good quarter of an hour they had been hobnobbing together , and the old business agent had been engaged in explaining to his man the particular service he required of him . To start with , indeed , and by way of preliminary to insure the confidence and good will of his ally , Père Moche , as he shook hands on saying good - morning , had slipped between the “ Gasman 's ” gnarled fingers a nice little bank note for fifty francs , which the apache , nothing if not practical , had instantly pocketed , prepared to learn later on what he would have to do in return , or even to refuse to take on the job if he did not fancy it . When the bottle was half empty , Moche came back to the business in hand . “ Then it 's settled , ” he asked , “ we may count on you ? ” The apache pushed his chair back , leant his great body far across	” he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he sat on the table , and he sat down on the table , he sat down on the table , he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , he sat on the table , and he sat on the table , he sat on the table , and he sat on the table , he sat on the table , he sat on the table , and he sat down on the table , he sat on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the table , and he sat down on the

The dress was more an object of veneration than anything else ; but she wrapped it , and the ribband and the piece of lace that she wore with it , into the bundle , and put them , with her spinning wheel and a pair of blue vases that had been her first parlour ornaments , on the back verandah where they would be easy to get if the fires threatened the house . Deirdre moved restlessly about out of doors , watching the haze on every side of the clearing for any sign of a break in it . """""""" Are there any animals on the place , Mrs. Cameron ?

"""""""" Keep 'em there , Jock ! """""""" she said and left the old dog shepherding them in the yard behind the barns . While she was away , Mrs. Cameron and Jenny had bundled half a dozen hens and a game rooster into a big wicker crate . Just before sunset they went to the hill - top together , Mrs. Cameron and Deirdre , and Jenny buzzing before them . Not a puff of air stirred the tawny curtain that obscured the hills . At a little distance the trees stood motionless . The light leaves of the young gum saplings hung , down - pointed , with a stillness that had tragedy in it . Faint and far away in the silence though was a rushing murmur . The smell of burning that had been in the air for days came with a harsher tang . Darkness was making way against the smoke - haze . Neither Deirdre nor Mrs. Cameron spoke , staring into it . A flock of parroquets flew out of the haze and scattered across the clearing with shrill , startled screams . A little brown feathered bird dropped into the grass . Deirdre picked it up . """""""" Its wings are singed , """""""" she said quickly , """""""" and they 're quite hot still !

I gave her silk - clad leg a poke with my nose . She smelled lovely . """""""" Thank you , Ponto , """""""" she said courteously . I rested my head on my paws and looked at Winnie .

The old negro boxers , who were seconding the early bouts , came to the ringside , pitched some much tattered gloves into the ring and hoisted two backless chairs into opposite corners . A couple of lanky lads , shivering in serapes , climbed through the ropes to the chairs , were gloved and introduced ; then the gong struck and the bouts began . The boxing , when it did begin , was fast and very skilful : it roused the partisans in the coloured men 's benches to fight with banana skins and half - sucked oranges . There were five , not six “ contests of the three rounds , ” and only one of the six went to the end of the third round . “ These lads are good at their business , ” Captain Cary said . “ Yes , sir ; there are two or three fine clever lads among those .

, the Minister insisted : “ You must admit , M. Havard , that this refusal to come and see me is , to say the least , extraordinary . Why , deuce take it , if Tom Bob was not wounded , that is to say , was not guilty , that is to say , had not pressing reasons for not showing himself just now , he would have come along here post haste . How did he know I was not meaning to decorate him ? ” M. Havard laughed frankly at the great man 's little joke ; he was still laughing when the brougham stopped at the door of the Hôtel Terminus . “ Whatever you do , ” the Minister observed , as they got out , “ whatever you do , address me as ‘ my dear fellow , ' from now on . I do n't at all like the idea of that American being able to boast of having put out a Minister of France . I mean to preserve the strictest incognito . ” M.

Running out to the top of the steps I was just in time to see Bartley coming up their length — coming slowly and not alone . His pajamas were stained by the dirt and the grass . In one hand was his revolver which was shoved against the back of the man who walked in front of him — a man who walked slowly and reluctantly , a man whose face I could not see . He was a tall man whose hands were hidden by his side and who wore a dark suit . For a moment I wondered who it might be . Then there began to come a dawning recognition . Up the steps they came , and Bartley 's face was very set . At the top step the man hesitated , only to have Bartley utter a sharp command and push against his back with the revolver . Then as they reached my side , the man lifted his head and looked at me . With one glance I recognized him . There before me , his yellow face calm as if he had just come from a pleasure trip , yet with his dark eyes flashing , was the gentleman who had visited us a while before . The Chinaman stood before us . Chapter XIII We Hear a Story — and — Discover It Is True No one spoke for a moment . Perhaps we were all too surprised to say anything . The calmest one of all was the oriental . His black suit was rumpled and covered with dirt from the path , but his face was calm and impassive . Only the narrow eyes gave any hint of feeling , and the glare in them was not a pleasant one . Then as with a short command Bartley pushed the gun closer against the man 's back , we went into the house , down the hall , and into the living room . As we dropped into chairs , Bartley motioned to his prisoner to be seated . With a slight shrug of his shoulders the Chinaman sank into his seat . Never taking his eyes off him , Bartley walked over to the chair near the table , directly opposite . As he seated himself , the revolver in his lap , the two men eyed each other in a long questioning gaze . There seemed more curiosity in the almond - shaped eyes than fear . With a little gesture , the Chinaman murmured : “ If it had not been for a chair — ” There came no reply from Bartley . Ranville was studying the oriental with a deliberateness which took in every feature , as though he was trying to remember if he had ever seen him in London . And then all at once the man spoke again . His voice was cool and low as if he were making a social	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
, ” he said , “ and I 've sailed aboard his ship these ten years . ” “ But whoever would bewitch him ? ” asked Mistress Pullen , looking up innocently , as though no hint of the affairs of the Ship had reached her . “ A marvellous pretty wench , ” said Blueneck , and then he added hastily , “ but of no comparison with thee , señora . ” Mistress Amy laughed . “ ‘ Tis a flatterer you are , ” she said , “ but I never heard of a pretty wench of the Ship , Master Blueneck ; will she be one of the Island girls ? ” Blueneck looked up . “ Ay , ” he said , “ ‘ tis a lass called Anny Farran . ” “ Oh ! ” Mistress Pullen 's eyebrows rose , and she pursed up her lips . “ That child ! ” Blueneck looked at her curiously . “ Hast heard aught against the lass ? ” he asked . Amy looked about her carefully , then leaning a little forward opened her mouth as though to speak , but as though another thought had crossed her mind she drew back and , shaking her head , said piously , “ But who am I to take away a poor slut 's character ? ' Tis not my nature , and I pray you , Master Blueneck , that you will not urge me , for my very conscience revolts against it . ” She paused . “ Though , mind you , I could an I would , ” she went on , “ but then , as I said , the story will do the lass no good . ” “ You make me curious , señora , ” said the sailor in his best manner . But Mistress Pullen for a very good reason , namely , that she could not think of a convincing story on the spot , was not to be prevailed on , and the conversation flagged for a time . At last she broke the silence . “ Then the Captain of the _ Coldlight _ is much attracted by this -- this , this wench ? ” she asked . “ Attracted ! ” Blueneck looked up excitedly . “ I tell you , mistress , I never saw him so before -- of course , you will understand , señora , there have been other women -- how could there not be ? But never has it been so that he has lost his delight in the trade . No , ” he added , “ it has not been like this these last ten years , and before then he was but a lad .

"""""""" That Llysanorh ' would see the comet Ralph never doubted for a second . He headed his comet - space flyer exactly toward the point where it would collide with Mars at the end of six days . He figured that the Martians would be on the lookout , and inasmuch as Ralph 's careful search did not reveal another space flyer anywhere near him , he knew that the Martian officials would surely locate and attempt to communicate with Llysanorh ' . In this he was not mistaken . His chronometer pointed to 5 p.m. when he first recorded weak signals coming from Mars . Several messages were exchanged between the Martians and Llysanorh ' . Llysanorh ' gave his number and position in the heavens and he in turn received instructions to approach as near to the """""""" comet 's """""""" head as feasible in order to change its course . He was also instructed to bombard the comet 's nucleus with time - set torpedoes , if he could not deviate the comet from its course . Llysanorh ' answered that he would follow instructions as far as his equipment allowed . During the next few days Ralph was relieved to note that the distance between him and Llysanorh ' diminished with great rapidity . His trick had worked . Llysanorh ' was rushing at top speed toward Ralph 's flyer , firmly believing it a comet . Confident of success , sure of victory , Ralph was jubilant . Hope , so long deferred , flooded his spirit . He whistled cheerily at his work . Was not every minute bringing him closer to his sweetheart , his Alice ? Was not every second drawing nearer to that moment when he would hold her in his arms ? What wonder that he whistled all day long , and laughed to himself from sheer joy and relief . At last the Martian came into range . Llysanorh ' approached the """""""" comet """""""" up to about 150 kilometers and then receded .

call your carriage , ” he said . The company was , in fact , rising from table ; it was growing very chilly and the time was come to think of quitting the Bois for the city . Everywhere the guests were exchanging farewells , then the women of fashion , escorted by their _ cavaliere servente _ , made for their elegant broughams or sumptuous automobiles . All were leaving , and leaving all at the same time , to return together as far as the barrier of the Porte Dauphine , when the final adieux would be exchanged . All together ? No , not so . There was one fair lady , at any rate , who did not intend to make one of the merry crowd . Indeed , the Grand Duchess Alexandra showed not the slightest desire to quit the table at which she had sat from the very beginning of the evening , isolated , sullen almost ! She had never ceased her watch of the official guests , and above all had not failed to mark the flattering attentions and manifestations of sympathy lavished everywhere on Tom Bob . Now her eyes were fixed askance on the Princess Sonia Danidoff , the acknowledged queen of the festivity , as she took the arm the detective offered . The white teeth of the Grand Duchess Alexandra were nervously biting her lip . The noble lady was doubtless thinking with acute agitation how she was the mistress of Fantômas and that this hero of the hour was the very same man who had sworn to bring her lover to the scaffold ! But it was high time to be gone , and the grand duchess summoned her _ chasseur _ . “ Call up my car , ” she ordered , “ but tell my chauffeur he is carefully to avoid returning with the rest of the company ; he is to drive by the less frequented roads . I do not care to be compelled to greet all these folks , who , luckily , have so far neither seen nor recognized me . ” The menial bowed and went his way , but he was back again next minute . “ Your Highness 's chauffeur , ” he said , “ has to inform your Highness that an accident has happened to the car ; he is busy repairing the damage , but it will take a good half - hour . Your Highness does not wish me to go for a hired carriage ? ” The Grand Duchess Alexandra , or rather Lady Beltham , seemed to hesitate a few moments . She cast a dark and venomous look of suddenly awakened anger in the direction of the last lingering guests mounting their vehicles , then quickly : “ No , I am in no hurry . Tell the chauffeur to do the repairs , and come and tell me when	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the back door instead of the front one . ” “ I do n't see how you make that out , ” broke in Patton . “ Look where he was killed , ” came the quick response from Ranville . “ Yes , ” said Bartley slowly . “ Look where the body was lying . You find it on its face with one hand reaching for the door — the open door only a few inches away . The man was shot in the back while his face was turned away from the person who shot him . He fell , naturally , in the position in which we found him . And that makes me think the gardener came in the rear door , got several feet within the building , when all at once he saw the person engaged in destroying the manuscript . ” “ But why did he turn to leave then ? ” was my question . “ It is my idea that when he turned to get out of the library , the other person had not seen him . Perhaps , even , the gardener knew who it was . He managed to go several feet before the man fired . I believe when he fired and the man fell and did not stir , he thought he had killed Patton . From the back , with the same colored suit , and the same general build , they look a bit alike . ” It seemed logical enough , and I could tell from the men 's faces that they agreed . Then all at once Carter gave a sudden cry and said that we must get the chief . He started for the telephone , only to have Bartley call out to him : “ George , do n't tell the chief what we want him for . Tell him to come right up here , but say nothing about the murder . I have my reasons . ” Carter shrugged his shoulders and , after fooling with the phone for some time , managed to get the chief . When he returned to our side , he said the chief was puzzled , wishing to know for what he was wanted , but he would come up right away . With this , we started to examine the room . But after a quick , though very careful , search on the part of Ranville and Bartley , there was nothing of importance found . Only the small pieces of torn paper , which filled the wastebasket and littered the floor by the desk , showed that anything had been touched . There was no doubt these pieces of paper had once comprised Warren 's notes — the notes which Patton said he had left on the desk . As we went over to the front door , Ranville , who was in the lead , bent over	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
what he was doing , but Billy thought that he knew , and he meant before he got thru to convince Donald that he knew . It did n't take very long , because there was nothing much to the young Quaker but voice , and he fainted at the fourth or fifth stroke , and after the twentieth stroke the doctor interfered . Then came the turn of Grady , secretary of the I. W. W. , and here a terrible thing happened . Grady , watching this scene from one of the cars , had grown desperate , and when they loosed the handcuffs to get off his coat , he gave a sudden wrench and broke free , striking down one man after another . He had been brought up in the lumber country , and his strength was amazing , and before the crowd quite realized it , he was leaping between two of the cars . A dozen men sprang upon him from a dozen directions , and he went down in the midst of a wild melee . They pinned him with his face mashed into the dirt , and from the crowd there rose a roar as from wild beasts in the night - time , “ String him up ! String him up ! ” One man came running with a rope , shouting , “ Hang him ! ” The master of ceremonies tried to protest thru his megaphone , but the instrument was knocked out of his hands , and he was hauled to one side , and presently there was a man climbing up the pine tree and hanging the rope over a limb . You could not see Grady for the jostling throng about him , but suddenly there was a yell from the crowd , and you saw him quite plainly -- he shot high up into the air , with the rope about his neck and his feet kicking wildly . Underneath , men danced about and yelled and waved their hats in the air , and one man leaped up and caught one of the kicking feet and hung onto it . Then , above all the din , a voice was heard thru the megaphone , “ Let him down a bit ! Let me get at him ! ” And those who held the rope gave way , and the body came down toward the ground , still kicking , and a man took out a clasp - knife , and cut the clothing away from the body , and cut off something from the body ; there was another yell from the crowd , and the men in the automobiles slapped their knees and shrieked with satisfaction . Those in the car with Peter whispered that it was Ogden , son of the president of the Chamber of Commerce ; and all over town next day and for weeks thereafter men would	I. before and out presently scene and town time terrible and yelled this instrument for long throng and to yell for long throng and because grown and slapped you , when that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about down , that about , he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang , and he sprang

of them was stained dark with age until they were almost black in color . I had noticed these three boxes as they stood on the three tables , but I had not been interested in them , chiefly because of the fact that I had been unable to lift the covers . All three of the tables , which after all were more stands than anything else , were on the side of the desk nearest the door . Two of them were over to the extreme left , near the bookcases , the other was more in the center near the safe . It was to this one Bartley hastened , it being the one the chief had mentioned over the phone . For several moments we stood looking down at it . The box was dingy with the years — a box three feet at least in length and several feet high . The edges were weird dragons , the tails at the corners making the little rests upon which the casket stood . Bartley reached out his hand and tried to open the massive gold lock , but without success . The casket was securely locked . He stood looking at it for a moment , then picked it up in his two hands . I could tell by the look he gave us that it was heavy . He placed it again on the stand , and then glanced around the room . As his eyes fell upon the other two caskets , he crossed the room to look at them , we following . It needed but a glance to see that they were alike in every particular — made of the same kind of wood , with the identical dragons on each corner ; and like the first one we had noticed , they were also locked . After he had lifted each one he turned to us . “ I think we had better make an effort to open that box . In a sense we have no right to do so ; but I have a keen desire to know what is inside . ” When we returned to the first casket , he found it was not as easy to open as perhaps he had thought . The steel instrument which he used — a thing which would open almost any lock — in the end did its work , but not until the lock had been wrenched away , and a portion of the woodwork broken . Then as he threw up the lid , we came closer to see what was within . There was no inner cover to the box , for the wood was very thick and another was not needed . At first glance there seemed to be nothing of value . The top was covered with yellow sheets of straw paper , thick heavy paper , which rustled as Bartley lifted them up .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But Juve stopped him with a gesture full of an impressive dignity . “ Fantômas , ” he cried , still prompted by his admirable coadjutor Fandor , “ Fantômas scorns to work with his own hands , it is to you , you dogs , belongs the task of digging up the treasure you are going to divide amongst you . ” “ Proud beast ! ” growled the “ Beadle . ” But less sensitive , the rest of the apaches did not need twice telling ; they were quite ready to obey the orders of the master whose high authority imposed itself upon them in spite of everything . “ Bull's - eye ” and the “ Gasman ” sprang forward and had soon raised the two first flags — to find nothing underneath save sand . But taking advantage of the confused uproar that ensued , Fandor prompted again : “ Tell them to go on , tell them to raise the third stone , and you are saved ! ” The detective gave the order Fandor suggested . The two apaches raised the last flag — and started back in sheer terror ! An atrocious spectacle lay beneath their eyes , Juve himself , who had stepped forward to see , stood there transfixed with horror . The third stone covered a black hole in the ground in which lay a corpse half devoured by the worms ! The flesh showed the greenish hues of decomposition and exhaled a poisonous stench . The chest had fallen in , a mass of shattered bones and disintegrated , putrefying flesh , and from its midst gleamed the white , polished handle of a metal money - chest . Where the dead man 's heart should have been a strongbox had been deposited . It was there the master had concealed the money destined for his confederates — a ghastly hiding place , a hideous repository ! Juve , who understood nothing and dared not so much as turn around to question Fandor with a look , yet retained his coolness . Henceforth an impassive spectator of the appalling scene , he stood waiting to become , when his friend should give the word , one of the heroes of the new scene that was now to be staged . Again Fandor prompted , and again Juve gave the order : “ Whoever of you is not afraid , let him go take the treasure from the depths of the ‘ tomb . ' ” The apaches gave a roar , but stood hesitating . All were bending over the gaping grave . Their eyes glittered with covetousness ; their grinning faces worked spasmodically in mingled repugnance and desire ; their hooked fingers twitched with eagerness to seize the shining handle of the treasure chest , the metal lid of which winked in the wavering light of the smoky lamps that supplied the only illumination in the gloomy	Fandor sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , er sprang , , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er schlug , er , er schlug , er , er , er schlug sich vor ihm , er er , er er schlug sich vor ihm , er er er schlug sich vor ihm , er er er er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , und er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er schlug sich vor ihm , er ehe
of the day , a dandy from the Brussels frill at his throat to the great silver buckles of rich workmanship which adorned his tanned shoes . But it was not these things which stopped the three sailors so suddenly in their talk and caused them to sit aghast . The most remarkable thing about the newcomer was his face -- long , lean , brown , and unhandsome , it yet had a character at once interesting and repulsive . The finely marked eyebrows met across the low , well - tanned brow in an almost straight line , and the hair -- oiled and curled -- showed as black as the silk kerchief which covered the greater part of head and neck . The eyes beneath the lids , fringed with heavy lashes , smiled and glittered disconcertingly . The whole face was smiling now , viciously , almost fiendishly , but yet smiling and with some enjoyment . Blueneck 's eyes dropped before that terrible smile and , as they travelled slowly downward , suddenly dilated , and he shivered as though a snake had touched him . The figure by the mast had moved a little more round and his hand was visible . It was at this that Blueneck stared . Among the small , white , much - beringed fingers , and round the slender wrist from which the lace ruffle had been pushed back a little , slid the thin blue blade of a Spanish stiletto . Through the thumb and first finger it slipped , over the blue vein of the white forearm , mingled its brightness with the flashing jewels on the third and fourth fingers -- and so round again , all without any apparent effort or even movement of the hand . It was an exhibition to be admired and praised , yet Blueneck and the shivering little man at his side shuddered and looked away . Mat Turnby , on the other hand , had not seen anything . He sat quite still , the pistol lying idly in the palm of his great hand , staring fixedly in front of him . A hand , white and slender , slid over his left shoulder and away again -- the pistol vanished . Still Mat did not move . “ A very pretty toy , and a useful , my friend , ” said the same soft voice , just behind Mat 's ear . The big sailor pulled himself together with an effort , stood up , then turned toward his captain . Blueneck and the little man in the blanket also rose . Black'erchief Dick had not changed his position . The big pistol and the slender knife lay side by side on his small white palm , and he still smiled as he spoke again : “ Now my noble son of an ox , ” he began pleasantly , his white teeth shining ,	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

carib leaf under his feet . Two guards advanced , struck Sagrado suddenly on the wrists , knocking them together , then instantly twisted the twitch or cuero about them and wrenched it taut . Sard thought , “ I have often heard that they put the twitch on criminals . They can break a man 's wrists with it , so they say . Now there it is , actually done , before my eyes . They have him at their mercy . ” Sagrado neither spoke nor struggled . He was like one drugged and unable to speak through the drug . He thought no more of Sard , but plainly did not yet know what had happened . The negro had turned whitish under his colour : the Indians moved no muscle . The Dictator strode through the guards and spoke . “ So , ” he said , “ a nice , pretty Christian scene of play ! And Harker mio , my benefactor . One turn deserves another . ” Guardias kept flooding into the room . They sorted themselves into couples , who advanced , each couple , to an Indian , put the cuero on him and dragged him aside . The Dictator with his own hands beat and tore at Margarita 's chains . A chief of guardias , who had keys about him , unlocked the padlocks ; the chains clanked to the floor , Sard and Margarita were free . The two reefers were white and subdued , but both were kind and helpful . They brought chairs for the two victims , and then , after a little search , brought water in some bronze bowls and mopped their brows . “ You 're among friends , Miss , ” they said . “ No one shall hurt you . ” “ You 're all right , sir , ” they said to Sard ; “ you 'll soon feel better .

But , modifying his statement and blushing to the roots of his hair , he added : “ Still , I am bound to confess , there is something makes her not indifferent to me . ” Tom Bob raised his hand as if to invoke heaven , and in a thrilling voice : “ The child , perhaps ... ” he suggested . “ Yes , that is it , ” Ascott agreed , and hurrying over the good - byes , he returned to his working - table , while the detective took his departure . * * * * * At the far end of the Bois de Vincennes , near the Saint - Mandé boundary of the park , is to be found , standing among trees , a restaurant of quite a rural aspect , and bearing the significant name of _ The Orange Blossom _ .

It is here in fact that the democracy resorts to make merry on the occasion of weddings after the religious or civil ceremonies , sometimes one , sometimes the other , occasionally both , have been rapidly despatched . This morning evidently the landlord of _ The Orange Blossom _ was not expecting any great number of customers , for he had thrown open only the smallest of his salons .

As the chestnut flew out along the green roadsides , that mean voice with its geniality and thin - edged malice , reverberated in Deirdre 's ears . She looked back when she was some distance out on the flat road that wound over the plains to the hills , and saw McNab hobbling back towards the whitewashed irregular and dilapidated huts of the Wirree township . Her eyes went out to the ranges with an eager sigh . She quickened the chestnut 's pace again with a rub of her heels on his sleek side . CHAPTER XXX Deirdre 's spirits rose as White Socks climbed the steep track of the foothills . She drew the strong , sweet leafy smells of the trees with eager breaths . Tying her hat to the saddle , she threw back her head to the sunshine , exclaiming with delight to see the red and brown prickly - shrub blossom out among the ferns , sunlight making the young leaves hang upon the saplings in flakes of translucent green , ruddy - gold and amber . She talked to Socks and called to the birds that flitted across the track . It was so good to be in the hills again , climbing the long , winding path through the trees . She wanted to catch the sunshine in her hands ; it hung in such yarns of palpable gold stuff across the track . She sang softly to herself , gazing into the blue haze that stood among the near trees . The valleys were steeped in sun mists . Her little horse ambled easily through them , and when he climbed the steep hill sides , she slipped from his back and walked beside him , asking him again and again , if it were not good to be going to Steve 's , to the paddocks where Socks himself had flung up his heels an unbroken colt , and all the gay , careless days of her childhood had been spent . She felt as if they were leaving the reek and squalor of the Wirree River for ever . And yet the vague uneasiness McNab 's words had evoked hovered in her mind . His eyes , gestures , ugly writhing smile , kept recurring to her . She was anxious to get to the Schoolmaster and give him McNab 's message , to know what he would make of it .

"knows . It was about midafternoon when our boat , followed by a fleet of smaller craft , glided out onto this lovely expanse of water . At a point about halfway down the lake , we had our first view of Narnawnla Prendella , the Golden City . I say view , but it was in reality but little more than a glimpse that we obtained . For , almost at that very moment , a dense gloom fell upon water and landscape . Fierce and dreadful were the flickerings along the roof a mile or more above us . So sudden and awful was the change that even the Dromans seemed astonished . There was a blinding flash overhead , and then utter blackness everywhere . Rhodes and I flashed on our lights . For a time the Dromans waited , as though expecting the light to come at any moment ; but it did not come . Along the shore on either side and in the distant city , lights were gleaming out . A sudden voice came , mystic and wonderful ; Rhodes and I turned , and there was Drorathusa standing with arms extended upward in invocation , as we had seen her in that first eclipse . Minutes passed . But the light did not come . At last the oars were put in motion again . Dark and agitated , however , were the looks of the Dromans , and more than one pair of eyes fixed themselves on Rhodes and me in a manner that plainly marked us as objects of some superstitious dread -- if , indeed , it was not something worse .

, where the Martinez ' slaves had lived in old time . They were plainly given over to the rats and scorpions ; there was nothing suspicious there , except that in one of the ruins there was a faint smell of tobacco , as though someone had smoked there during the day . “ And who could have smoked there ? Who could have , or would have ? No one living here . ” He could see no cigar - stub , nor cigarette - end , no match , nor sign of smoker ; there was nothing there except the memory or ghost of tobacco ; it was hardly even a smell , hardly a flavour . By opening his mouth and breathing in , Hilary felt the record of tobacco against his palate . Then , on the wall , he saw a faint luminous streak , which at first he thought to be one of the centipedes which glow with the decay they live in . Looking at it with a light , he saw a match streak . Someone had struck a wax match there , probably during the day , since the phosphorescence still showed . Who could have been there with a wax - match ? No native , no one employed about the house . “ That limits it , ” he said , “ to members of the Club , like Coghill . ” When he left the out - houses , he walked along the foot of the perron to the verandah . All seemed quiet there : the night was darker , the stars brighter , and the harbour lights twinkled more , but the sea - breeze was not setting in . “ It is a lovely night , ” he said . “ All this rag business is absurd . I will not give it another thought . I will send Ramón , or one of the boys , down to the police , perhaps , for Margaret 's sake ; but I will see that Coghill is paid for this . What is that white thing on the shingle there ? ” The white thing lay on the ground near the steps leading to the verandah , in such a position that he must have seen it , had it been there when he left the house . “ It was not there when I came down , ” he said . It was a large , coarse , dirty - white linen handkerchief with a coloured border . “ This will be Ramón 's , ” he said . He went into the house , and called for Ramón , but received no answer . At his fourth call , his sister answered over the railings of the floor above : “ Ramón has gone out , ” she said . “ He went into the garden five minutes ago , to look for	, ” he said , “ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he , “ ” , “ , ” he said , “ , ” ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” ” and he , “ ” he , “ ” and he , “ ” ” he said , “ , ” and he , “ ” ” and he , “ ” ” and , “ ” he , “ ” and , ” he said .
house . The book has McCormick 's name in it . ” There were many exclamations over this , and Peter had time to think before the company turned upon him again . The Chief of Police now questioned him , and then the deputy of the district attorney questioned him ; still he stuck to his story . “ My God ! ” he cried . “ Would you think I 'd be mad enough to frame up a job like this ? Where 'd I get all that stuff ? Where 'd I get that dynamite?”--Peter almost bit off his tongue as he realized the dreadful slip he had made . No one had ever told him that the suit - case actually contained dynamite ! How had he known there was dynamite in it ? He was desperately trying to think of some way he could have heard ; but , as it happened , no one of the five men caught him up . They all knew that there was dynamite in the suit - case ; they knew it with overwhelming and tremendous certainty , and they overlooked entirely the fact that Peter was n't supposed to know it . So close to the edge of ruin can a man come and yet escape ! Peter made haste to get away from that danger - spot . “ Does Joe Angell deny that he was whispering to Jerry Rudd ? ” “ He does n't remember that , ” said Guffey . “ He may have talked with him apart , but nothing special , there was n't any conspiracy . ” “ Does he deny that he talked about dynamite ? ” “ They may have talked about it in the general discussion , but he did n't whisper anything . ” “ But I heard him ! ” cried Peter , whose quick wits had thought up a way of escape , “ I know what I heard ! It was just before they were leaving , and somebody had turned out some of the lights . He was standing with his back to me , and I went over to the book - case right behind him . ” Here the deputy district attorney put in . He was a young man , a trifle easier to fool than the others . “ Are you sure it was Joe Angell ? ” he demanded . “ My God ! Of course it was ! ” said Peter . “ I could n't have been mistaken . ” But he let his voice die away , and a note of bewilderment be heard in it . “ You say he was whispering ? ” “ Yes , he was whispering . ” “ But might n't it have been somebody else ? ” “ Why , I do n't know what to say , ” said Peter . “ I thought for sure	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

newspaper _ canard _ ... very American , too American ... I do n't believe it , do you ? ” “ Egad ! ” confessed M. Havard , very much put out , “ I am bound to allow that this Tom Bob exists , and even that he enjoys a certain reputation in the New York police force , but then , to advertise himself like that , really ! ” M. Casamajols suggested with a smile of irony : “ Eh , Havard , suppose Tom Bob _ did _ run down and arrest Fantômas ? ” Lifting his hands to heaven , the Chief of the Investigation Department turned his back on the Procureur Général : “ God Almighty ! ” he swore , “ had n't we enough to worry us , enough to make us look ridiculous , without this Tom Bob shoving his finger in the pie . Upon my word , it 's the last straw , that ! ... ” Havard stopped dead in the middle of his tirade ; the door of the room had opened . “ Do you mean me by that , Monsieur Havard ? ” demanded the newcomer . M. Havard curbed a gesture of annoyance ; decidedly he was in Fortune 's bad books that day . He drew back , and bowing low to the President of the Council — it was no other than M. Monnier himself who asked the question . “ I do assure you , sir , ” he replied respectfully , “ I should never allow myself to think such a thing of you . ” CHAPTER IX THE BLUE CHESTNUT “ Get along then that 's no way to treat people ! What 's he want with me , anyway , the nasty fellow ? ” Nini Guinon was furious ; turning sharply round , she thus apostrophized an individual who had just signalized his presence by tickling her ribs more roughly than agreeably . It was a Monday , and about two o'clock in the afternoon . Nini had just issued from the Poissonnière Gate ; mounting the bank overhanging the moat of the fortifications and turning to the left , she was making for Saint - Ouen . The young woman stared suspiciously at the man who was following her without a word , good , bad or indifferent , a smile of doubtful import on his face . Presently , reassured more or less by her examination of the stranger , Nini added : “ I thought it was the ‘ cops ' . ” The man shrugged his shoulders . “ D'you think I belong to the police ? do I look like it ? ” “ No , you do n't , ” Nini admitted ; “ but come , let 's have a peep at your phiz ; what does this here masquerading mean , eh ? ” Obeying the young woman	, ” he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he shook his head ; he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , 
driver was his confederate . Soon this particular cab hove in sight ; indeed it had never been very far from the scene of action . It was a taxi that had been following the little group ever since they left the Pont Solférino . Paulet meanwhile was playing his part splendidly . With the help of the big fellow with the knotty hands who had butted into the Minister in the first instance , he was clearing a ring , pushing back the over curious . “ I beseech you , ladies and gentlemen , ” he was shouting , “ go away ; it 's a poor fellow , an invalid , who has just had an attack . Yes , he 's in a fit ... he 's ill , ” he kept repeating , and everybody agreed the young man was perfectly right . The Minister in fact , utterly at sea as to what had befallen him , merely aware that he could not utter a word and that they would not let him get up , was writhing and wriggling like a man possessed . A frothy lather covered his cheeks and poured from between his lips . The spectators were of one mind , all repeating parrot - wise the same words : “ It 's a man been taken ill , an epileptic just had an attack ! ” The taxi selected by old Moche drew up to the pavement . With the help of kind - hearted assistants , Paulet and his accomplice hoisted the Minister into the cab , still vainly resisting ! The two brigands took their places inside with their victim ; then , just as the vehicle got under weigh , old Moche with surprising agility sprang on the step and took his seat beside the chauffeur . The plot had succeeded — a triumph , indeed ! But , after all , with what object had they kidnapped the Minister of Justice ? What did they expect to make of it ? In the Chamber at the Palais - Bourbon , excitement was at its height . There was a constant coming and going of Deputies , talking together eagerly without paying the smallest attention to the demand for silence from the President 's chair , whose bell rang out unceasingly . Presently , however , quiet was restored when the President of the Council , the much respected M. Monnier , mounted the tribune to make the following announcement : “ Gentlemen , I regretted a while ago to have to inform you that our honourable colleague , M. Désiré Ferrand , Minister of Justice , had not returned to his house ... I have this moment received an extraordinary letter , so extraordinary in fact that I am tempted to believe it to be the work of a practical joker . Nevertheless , under present circumstances , I consider it my duty to make	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
succeeded in figuring out a way , and hurried upstairs to the writing - room and penned a note : “ Nell : This is your old friend Peter Gudge . I have struck it rich and have important news for you . Be sure to send word to me . Peter . ” To this he added his address , and sealed it in an envelope to “ Miss Nell Doolin . ” Then he went out into the lobby , and signalled to one of the brass - button imps who went about the place calling names in shrill sing - song ; he got this youngster off in a corner and pressed a dollar bill into his hand . There was a young lady in the grill who was to have this note at once . It was very important . Would the brass - button imp do it ? The imp said sure , and Peter stood in the doorway and watched him walk back and forth thru the aisles of the grill , calling in his shrill sing - song , “ Miss Nell Doolin ! Miss Nell Doolin ! ” He walked right by the table where Nell sat eating ; he sang right into her face , it seemed to Peter ; but she never gave a sign . Peter did not know what to make of it , but he was bound to get that note to Nell . So when the imp returned , he pointed her out , and the imp went again and handed the note to her . Peter saw her take it -- then he darted away ; and remembering suddenly that he was supposed to be on duty , be rushed back to the office and inquired for Mr. Lackman . To his horror he learned that Mr. Lackman had returned , paid his bill , and departed with his suitcase to a destination unknown ! Section 39 Peter had a midnight appointment with McGivney , and now had to go and admit this humiliating failure . He had done his best , he declared ; he had inquired at the desk , and waited and waited , but the hotel people had failed to notify him of Lackman 's arrival . All this was strictly true ; but it did not pacify McGivney , who was in a black fury . “ It might have been worth thousands of dollars to you ! ” he declared . “ He 's the biggest fish we 'll ever get on our hook . ” “ Wo n't he come again ? ” asked grief - stricken Peter . “ No , ” declared the other . “ They 'll get him at his home city . ” “ But wo n't that do ? ” asked Peter , naively . “ You damned fool ! ” was McGivney 's response . “ We wanted to get him	Doolin sat in the corner of the room and waited for Peter to return , and he waited for him , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited , and he waited .
Rounds . Twenty Rounds . Twenty Three - Minute Rounds . Between El Chico , Champion Caribe de la Tierra Firme , And Ben Hordano , Champion , of Mexico City . Grand Feast of Pugilism . At three o'clock punctually . ” “ H'm ! ” Captain Cary said , “ it 's nearly three now . They evidently wo n't begin very punctually , for we are almost the only white people here . We might have had time to go down the south end of the water - front to see that new floating dock they 've got there . ” “ Shall we go , then , sir ? ” “ No . It 's too late now . We 're here now . We may as well stay here now we are here . It 's a dock badly needed in Las Palomas and I wanted to see it . It 's like the one they have at San Agostino . ” They sat talking while they waited , but there was always a professional restraint about their talk . Captain Cary ashore was still “ the old man , ” Sard Harker , the mate , was still , in the captain 's eyes , the boy whom he had taught to steer . Both found themselves staring ahead over the further wall of the arena , at the old Spanish fortifications as white as spray beyond . There came a pounce and squeal in the air just over the open ring . There were excited cries from the negroes , the wail died out and a few feathers drifted down into the ring . “ What is it ? ” Captain Cary asked . “ A hawk , sir ; it came down and struck and carried away a little bird just over the ring . ” “ That is what they call an omen of something . ” “ An omen that the better fighter is going to win , sir . ” They were still almost the only whites in the arena . They chatted or were silent while the other side of the arena filled up with negroes and half - breeds who had come to cheer the Carib . Many of these , being young men , were dressed in what was then the extreme fashion among the coloured peoples . This fashion was based on the belief that youth is irresistible : it dressed men to look young . That there might be no doubt about it , the costumes chosen were those of little boys of six or seven years of age . About a hundred of the young bloods of Las Palomas were wearing little round straw sailor hats , with ribbons hanging from the bands over their faces . On their bodies they wore little sailor suits , with flopping collars and very short knickerbockers . Their legs were mostly bare from above the knee	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
” said Sue , seeing her , “ the foreigner would drink sack -- wilt get it for him ? ” There was not much call for Canary sack at the Ship , so Anny was some minutes finding and tapping a cask . When she returned from the cellar , a flagon in her hand , the talk had become more animated and one or two lively spirits had started a song , but above the noise a voice penetrating although musical was saying loudly , “ Marry , Master French , do you never drink aught but rum in the East that a gentleman is kept waiting ten minutes for a cup of sack ? ” French 's deep tones replied slowly : “ Nay , Captain , very little else but rum ; sack be only for gentlefolk . ” Anny hastened forward . “ Here 's for you , sir , ” she said briskly , and then stopped , awe - struck before the Spaniard , dazzled by his appearance . Black'erchief Dick stretched out a white jewelled hand for the tankard without looking at the girl . “ Thank thee , mistress , ” he said carelessly , lifting it to his lips . Still Anny did not move and Hal Grame , looking up from the rum keg which he was tapping , cursed the Spaniard 's clothes with that honest venom which is only known to youth . “ Ah , a good draught ! ” The Spaniard put down the pot and touched his lips with a lace - edged handkerchief . “ Mistress , another by your leave , ” he said suddenly . Then his gaze , too , became fixed , his dark eyes taking in every detail of her face . “ God 's Fool ! ” he exclaimed . “ Mistress , you are wondrous fair . ” Anny blushed and , her senses returning to her , she curtseyed and taking up the empty tankard tripped off with a gentle--“As you wish , ” as she went . Black'erchief Dick stared after her for a second or two before he turned to French . “ By my faith , Master French , you have no poor skill in choosing a wench , ” he said . Big French laughed and reddened . “ Oh ! ” he said carelessly . “ ‘ Tis not she but the other I would have favour from . ” The Spaniard darted a look of misbelief at his big companion , but he said nothing , for Anny had returned and was standing before him , a brimming tankard in her hand . Black'erchief Dick took the wine and set it by untasted , but retained the brown hand which was even smaller than his own and held it firmly . “ Mistress , ” he said , and Anny thought she had never seen such bright merry eyes	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The rich men were all subscribing to liberty bonds ; the poor men were going to give their lives ; and what was Peter Gudge going to give ? “ Maybe I 'll be drafted into the army , ” Peter remarked . “ No , you won't -- not if you take this job , ” said McGivney . “ We can fix that . A man like you , who has special abilities , is too precious to be wasted . ” Peter decided forthwith that he would accept the proposition . It was much more sensible to spend a few days in jail than to spend a few years in the trenches , and maybe the balance of eternity under the sod of France . Matters were quickly arranged . Peter took off his good clothes , and dressed himself as became a workingman , and went into the eating - room where Donald Gordon , the Quaker boy , always got his lunch . Peter was quite sure that Donald would be one of the leading agitators against the draft , and in this he was not mistaken . Donald was decidedly uncordial in his welcoming of Peter ; without saying a word the young Quaker made Peter aware that he was a renegade , a coward who had “ thrown down ” the Goober defense . But Peter was patient and tactful ; he did not try to defend himself , nor did he ask any questions about Donald and Donald 's activities . He simply announced that he had been studying the subject of militarism , and had come to a definite point of view . He was a Socialist and an Internationalist ; he considered America 's entry into the war a crime , and he was willing to do his part in agitating against it . He was going to take his stand as a conscientious objector ; they might send him to jail if they pleased , or even stand him against a wall and shoot him , but they would never get him to put on a uniform . It was impossible for Donald Gordon to hold out against a man who talked like that ; a man who looked him in the eye and expressed his convictions so simply and honestly . And that evening Peter went to a meeting of Local American City of the Socialist Party , and renewed his acquaintance with all the comrades . He did n't make a speech or do anything conspicuous , but simply got into the spirit of things ; and next day he managed to meet some of the members , and whenever and wherever he was asked , he expressed his convictions as a conscientious objector . So before a week had passed Peter found that he was being tolerated , that nobody was going to denounce him as a traitor , or kick him out of the room	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
of politics was rotten , these would argue ; a politician could find more ways to fool the workers in a minute than the workers could thwart in a year . They pointed to the German Socialists , those betrayers of internationalism . There were people who called themselves Socialists right here in American City who wanted to draw the movement into the same kind of trap ! This debate was not conducted in the realm of abstractions ; the two wings of the movement would attack one another with bitterness . The “ politicians ” would denounce the “ impossibilists , ” calling them “ anarchists ; ” and the other side , thus goaded , would accuse their enemies of being in the hire of the government . Peter would supply McGivney with bits of scandal which the “ under cover ” men would start going among the “ left - wingers ; ” and in the course of the long wrangles in the local these accusations would come out . Herbert Ashton would mention them with his biting sarcasm , or “ Shorty ” Gunton would shout them in one of his tirades--“hurling them into his opponents teeth , ” as he phrased it . “ Shorty ” Gunton was a tramp printer , a wandering agitator who was all for direct action , and did n't care a hang who knew it . “ Violence ? ” he would say . “ How many thousand years shall we submit to the violence of capitalist governments , and never have the right to reply ? ” And then again he would say , “ Violence ? Yes , of course we must repudiate violence -- until we get enough of it ! ” Peter had listened to “ Shorty 's ” railings at the “ compromisers ” and the “ political traders , ” and had thought him one of the most dangerous men in American City . But later on , after the episode of Joe Angell had opened Peter 's eyes , he decided that “ Shorty ” must also be a secret agent like himself . Peter was never told definitely , but he picked up a fact here and there , and fitted them together , and before long his suspicion had become certainty . The “ left wing ” Socialists split off from the party , and called a convention of their own , and this convention in turn split up , one part forming the Communist Party , and another part forming the Communist Labor Party . While these two conventions were in session , McGivney came to Peter , and said that the Federal government had a man on the platform committee of the Communist Party , and they wanted to write in some phrases that would make membership in that party in itself a crime , so that everybody who held a membership card could be sent to prison	” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” 
thing he had eaten , except the buttered toast . He was inwardly quaking with embarrassment during this meal , but he saved himself by Mrs. James 's formula , to watch and see what the others were doing and then do likewise . Each time a new course was brought , Peter would wait , and when he saw Mrs. Godd pick up a certain fork or a certain spoon , he would pick up the same one , or as near to it as he could guess . He could put his whole mind on this , because he did n't have to do any talking ; Mrs. Godd poured out a steady stream of sedition and high treason , and all Peter had to do was to listen and nod . Mrs. Godd would understand that his mouth was too full for utterance . After the luncheon they went out on the broad veranda which overlooked a magnificent landscape . The hostess got Peter settled in a soft porch chair with many cushions , and then waved her hand toward the view of the city with its haze of thick black smoke . “ That 's where my wage slaves toil to earn my dividends , ” said she . “ They 're supposed to stay there -- in their ` place , ' as it 's called , and I stay here in my place . If they want to change places , it 's called ` revolution , ' and that is ` violence . ' What I marvel at is that they use so little violence , and feel so little . Look at those men being tortured in jail ! Could anyone blame them if they used violence ? Or if they made an effort to escape ? ” That suggested a swift , stabbing idea to Peter . Suppose Mrs. Godd could be induced to help in a jail delivery ! “ It might be possible to help them to escape , ” he suggested . “ Do you think so ? ” asked Mrs. Godd , showing excitement for the first time during that interview . “ It might be , ” said Peter . “ Those jailors are not above taking bribes , you know . I met nearly all of them while I was in that jail , and I think I might get in touch with one or two that could be paid . Would you like me to try it ? ” “ Well , I do n't know-- ” began the lady , hesitatingly . “ Do you really think-- ” “ You know they never ought to have been put in at all ! ” Peter interjected . “ That 's certainly true ! ” declared Mrs. Godd . “ And if they could escape without hurting anyone , if they did n't have to fight the jailors , it would n't do any real	                                                         
that door on me ! I want to see Hetty Chilson . ” The man recognized the tone of white authority . “ Wha ' you want ? ” Magnolia recovered herself . After all , this was not the front door of a home , but of a House . “ Tell her Mrs. Gaylord Ravenal wants to speak to her . Tell her that I have one thousand dollars that belongs to her , and I want to give it to her . ” Foolishly she opened her bag and he saw the neat sheaf of bills . His eyes popped a little . “ Yes'm . Ah tell huh . Step in , ma'am . ” Magnolia entered Hetty Chilson 's house . She was frightened . The trembling had taken hold of her knees again . But she clutched the handbag and looked about her , frankly curious . A dim hallway , richly carpeted , its walls covered with a red satin brocade . There were deep soft cushioned chairs , and others of carved wood , high - backed . A lighted lamp on the stairway newel post cast a rosy glow over the whole . Huge Sèvres vases stood in the stained - glass window niches . It was an entrance hall such as might have been seen in the Prairie Avenue or Michigan Avenue house of a new rich Chicago packer . The place was quiet . Now and then you heard a door shut . There was the scent of coffee in the air . No footfall on the soft carpet , even though the tread were heavy . Hetty Chilson descended the stairs , a massive , imposing figure in a black - and - white patterned foulard dress . She gave the effect of activity hampered by some physical impediment . Her descent was one of impatient deliberateness . One hand clung to the railing . She appeared a stout , middle - aged , well - to - do householder summoned from some domestic task abovestairs . She had aged much in the last ten years . Magnolia , startled , realized that the distortion of her stout figure was due to a tumour . “ How do you do ? ” said Hetty Chilson . Her keen eyes searched her visitor 's face . The Negro hovered near by in the dim hallway . “ Are you Mrs. Ravenal ? ” “ Yes . ” “ What is it , please ? ” Magnolia felt like a schoolgirl interrogated by a stern but well - intentioned preceptress . Her cheeks were burning as she opened her handbag , took out the sheaf of hundred - dollar bills , tendered them to this woman . “ The money , ” she stammered , “ the money you gave my — you gave my husband . Here it is . ” Hetty Chilson looked at the bills . “	” Hetty stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , stout , a - - , a - - , a - - , a - - , a - - , a - - , a - - , a - - - , a - - , a - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
twenty - four hours would expire this evening . Certainly he had not meant to find himself in New Orleans . He had come aboard the _ Lady Lee _ at St. Louis , his finances low , his hopes high , his erstwhile elegant garments in their present precarious state . He had planned , following the game of stud poker in which he immediately immersed himself , to come ashore at Memphis or , at the latest , Natchez , with his finances raised to the high level of his hopes . Unfortunately his was an honest and over - eager game . His sole possession , beside the little slim malacca cane ( itself of small tangible value ) was a singularly clear blue - white diamond ring which he never wore . It was a relic of luckier days before his broadcloth had become shiny , his linen frayed , his boots split . He had clung to it , as he had to the cane , through almost incredible hazards . His feeling about it was neither sentimental nor superstitious . The tenuous streak of canniness in him told him that , possessed of a clear white diamond , one can hold up one 's head and one 's hopes , no matter what the state of coat , linen , boots , and hat . It had never belonged , fiction - fashion , to his sainted ( if any ) mother , nor was it an old Ravenal heirloom . It was a relic of winnings in luckier days and represented , he knew , potential hundreds . In the trip that lasted , unexpectedly , from St. Louis to New Orleans , he had won and lost that ring six times . When the _ Lady Lee _ had nosed her way into the Memphis landing , and again at Natchez , it had been out of his possession . He had stayed on board , perforce . Half an hour before coming into New Orleans he had had it again , and had kept it . The game of stud poker had lasted days , and he rose from it the richer by exactly nothing at all . He had glanced out of the _ Lady Lee 's _ saloon window , his eyes bloodshot from sleeplessness , his nerves jangling , his hands twitching , his face drawn ; but that face shaven , those hands immaculate . Gaylord Ravenal , in luck or out , had the habits and instincts of a gentleman . “ Good God ! ” he exclaimed now , “ this looks like — it is New Orleans ! ” It was N'Yawlins as he said it . “ What did you think it was ? ” growled one of the players , who had temporarily owned the diamond several times during the journey down river . “ What did you think it was ?	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

is it ? ” “ Now , ” said Peter , “ it 's like this . These police and all these fellows mean well , but they do n't understand ; it 's too complicated , they ai n't been in this movement long enough . They 're used to dealing with criminals ; but these Reds , you see , are cranks . Criminals ai n't organized , at least they do n't stand together ; but these Reds do , and if you fight ‘ em , they fight back , and they make what they call ` propaganda . ' And that propaganda is dangerous -- if you make a wrong move , you may find you 've made ‘ em stronger than they were before . ” “ Yes , I see that , ” said the old man . “ Well ? ” “ Then again , the police dunno how dangerous they are . You try to tell them things , they wo n't really believe you . I 've known for a long time there was a group of these people getting together to kill off all the rich men , the big men all over the country . They 've been spying on these rich men , getting ready to kill them . They know a lot about them that you ca n't explain their knowing . That 's how I got the idea they had somebody in your house , Mr. Ackerman . ” “ Tell me what you mean . Tell me at once . ” “ Well , sir , every once in a while I pick up scraps of conversation . One day I heard Mac-- ” “ Mac ? ” “ That 's McCormick , the one who 's in jail . He 's an I. W. W. leader , and I think the most dangerous of all . I heard him whispering to another fellow , and it scared me , because it had to do with killing a rich man . He 'd been watching this rich man , and said he was going to shoot him down right in his own house ! I did n't hear the name of the man -- I walked away , because I did n't want him to think I was trying to listen in . They 're awful suspicious , these fellows ; if you watch Mac you see him looking around over his shoulder every minute or two . So I strolled off , and then I strolled back again , and he was laughing about something , and I heard him say these words ; I heard him say , ` I was hiding behind the curtain , and there was a Spanish fellow painted on the wall , and every time I peeked out that bugger was looking at me , and I wondered if he was n't going to give me away	                                                        
we have eaten , I pray you . The morning will do , ” he said . “ Until then I would like to speak of this heinous crime of smuggling as carried on in this town and on the Island over the Fleet . ” Playle felt disquieted . Here he was in this old gentleman 's house , drying himself at his fire and making himself generally comfortable . How could he boldly announce that these affairs would be his care in future , and that Master Myddleton need trouble himself no further ? He decided to put it off till supper was over . After all , he considered the old man must know something of use to him in his future work . Master Playle was a very conscientious young man and one who had ambitions . He had fought for this appointment and meant to show his ability . He had served for a time in one of His Majesty 's own regiments and still held a commission . Master Myddleton began to speak . “ We have a very difficult task before us , Master Playle , ” he began in the deep pompous voice which he used on all official occasions . “ I think I can truthfully say that on no other part of the coast is King Charles ' law -- God bless him -- more persistently and I might almost say courageously violated . ” He paused , and his little gray eyes sought a flicker of surprise on the young man 's face , but they were disappointed . Playle 's easy smile still played round his thin lips as he listened with polite attention . Master Myddleton began again . “ With such violent , all - daring , cut - throat gang against me , I have -- er -- yes , to be plain with you , Master Playle -- I have -- er -- felt it unwise -- not to say foolhardy -- to take more than preliminary measures against these unruly vagabonds until I received assistance from headquarters . ” Playle 's smile deepened and Francis , looking up suddenly , saw it . Instantly his manner changed . “ Ah , I see you know something of their customs , Master Playle , ” he said , laughing wheezily . Playle looked up a little disconcerted , but he laughed with the old man and nodded his head . “ I can see I can be quite plain with you , ” went on Francis , his eyes scanning the other 's face . Playle was a simple , straightforward soldier , and he felt rather at a disadvantage with this quick - witted old villain with the gouty foot . However , he deemed it prudent to make some remark . “ Oh , yes , of a certainty , of a certainty ! ” he said as intelligently as possible .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
spent more time saying that than anything else . He 's sick , and he 's scared out of his wits . ” So at last McGivney condescended to thank Peter for his faithfulness , and went on to give him further orders . The Reds were raising an awful howl . Andrews , the lawyer , had succeeded in getting a court order to see the arrested men , and of course the prisoners had all declared that the case was a put - up job . Now the Reds were preparing to send out a circular to their fellow Reds all over the country , appealing for publicity , and for funds to fight the “ frame - up . ” They were very secret about it , and McGivney wanted to know where they were getting their money . He wanted a copy of the circular they were printing , and to know where and when the circulars were to be mailed . Guffey had been to see the post office authorities , and they were going to confiscate the circulars and destroy them all without letting the Reds know it . Peter rubbed his hands with glee . That was the real business ! That was going after these criminals in the way Peter had been urging ! The rat - faced man answered that it was nothing to what they were going to do in a few days . Let Peter keep on his job , and he would see ! Now , when the public was wrought up over this dynamite conspiracy , was the time to get things done . Section 55 Peter took a street car to the home of Miriam Yankovitch , and on the way he read the afternoon edition of the American City “ Times . ” The editors of this paper were certainly after the Reds , and no mistake ! They had taken McCormick 's book on Sabotage , just as Nell had predicted , and printed whole chapters from it , with the most menacing sentences in big type , and some boxed up in little frames and scattered here and there over the page so that no one could possibly miss them . They had a picture of McCormick taken in the jail ; he had n't had a chance to shave for several days , and probably had n't felt pleasant about having his picture taken -- anyhow , he looked ferocious enough to frighten the most skeptical , and Peter was confirmed in his opinion that Mac was the most dangerous Red of them all . Columns and columns of material this paper published about the case , subtly linking it up with all the other dynamitings and assassinations in American history , and with German spy plots and bomb plots . There was a nation - wide organization of these assassins , so the paper said ; they published hundreds of papers	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
profusely decorated with gold paint ; so much Anny could see by the light of the lantern which Dick gallantly held for her , and her name , “ ANNY , ” was painted on the bright blue band that went round the figure 's black head . “ ‘ Tis lovely , ” she whispered half to herself as she ran her fingers over the great arms and breasts on which the paint was hardly dry . Dick smiled and made her the obvious compliment , and they went down to the bows and leaned over the gunwale so as to see the four great white letters , “ ANNY , ” painted on the smooth brown sides . The girl was delighted , and her infectious gurgling laugh rang out clearly several times on the cold air as she listened to Dick 's sparkling conversation . “ Tide 's full and wind fair , ” sang out a voice suddenly from the watch - tower . Instantly there was confusion : Dick shouted orders here and there but did not take his hand from Anny 's arm . Everyone made for the boats shouting farewells to the crew which responded cheerfully . Dick bent nearer to the girl . “ I will come again , ” he said softly . Anny smiled and nodded . “ We are ever pleased to see company at the Ship , ” she said demurely , slipping her arm out of his grasp and moving over to the side where French , Sue , and Hal waited for her . Dick followed her . “ Give us your blessing , mistress , ” he said loudly . There was silence at once : the sailors attached much importance to a blessing and they stood quietly . Anny looked round desperately ; she had never had a blessing in her life , much less given one , and for a moment she was entirely at a loss . No one spoke , however , so at last she crossed herself devoutly and said as clearly as her nervousness would permit , “ I pray God bless this ship , Amen . ” “ Amen , ” repeated the crew solemnly , and then dashed off on their business and the bustle recommenced . Sue climbed over the side of the boat , French followed her , and then Hal . “ Farewell , Ann of the Island , ” said the Spaniard softly . “ I will return to thee . ” Anny looked at him and he seemed to her very comely . She held out her hand and he raised it to his lips . “ Farewell , sir , ” she said , and then followed her lover into the little boat . “ Farewell ! ” came the deep and almost beautiful voice again ; there was the clink of chains and the anchor was weighed , and then	ANNY , Anny , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY , ANNY !
was laboring elbow deep in soap - suds . It was on the tip of Peter 's tongue to say : “ If you really had done a day 's washing , Mrs. Godd , you would n't talk like that ! ” But he remembered that he must play the game , so he said , “ They 're terrible fellows , them Federal agents . It was two of them pounded me over the head last night . ” And then he looked faint and pitiful , and Mrs. Godd was sympathetic again , and moved to more recklessness of utterance . “ It 's because of this hideous war ! ” she declared . “ We 've gone to war to make the world safe for democracy , and meantime we have to sacrifice every bit of democracy at home . They tell you that you must hold your peace while they murder one another , but they may try all they please , they 'll never be able to silence me ! I know that the Allies are just as much to blame as the Germans , I know that this is a war of profiteers and bankers ; they may take my sons and force them into the army , but they can not take my convictions and force them into their army . I am a pacifist , and I am an internationalist ; I want to see the workers arise and turn out of office these capitalist governments , and put an end to this hideous slaughter of human beings . I intend to go on saying that so long as I live . ” There sat Mrs. Godd , with her lovely firm white hands clasped as if in prayer , one large diamond ring on the left fourth finger shining defiance , and a look of calm , child - like conviction upon her face , confronting in her imagination all the federal agents and district attorneys and capitalist judges and statesmen and generals and drill sergeants in the civilized world . She went on to tell how she had attended the trial of three pacifist clergymen a week or two previously . How atrocious that Christians in a Christian country should be sent to prison for trying to repeat the words of Christ ! “ I was so indignant , ” declared Mrs. Godd , “ that I wrote a letter to the judge . My husband said I would be committing contempt of court by writing to a judge during the trial , but I answered that my contempt for that court was beyond anything I could put into writing . Wait-- ” And Mrs. Godd rose gravely from her chair and went over to a desk by the wall , and got a copy of the letter . “ I 'll read it to you , ” she said , and Peter listened to a manifesto of Olympian	, ” he said , ” I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a pacifist , I 'm a , ” he said .

cellar . But none dared to move ; the apaches were afraid — for the first time ! But now the throng grouped round the hideous hole was pushed aside and an old woman , her face scarlet , her breath coming in gasps , advanced with arms akimbo to the edge of the grave . “ Why , what , ” she croaked , “ what 's amiss with you , you chaps ? to be scared of a dead man , for shame ! Well , I 'm only a woman , I am , but I 'm out to show you cowards what pluck means . True as I stand here , this hand I hold up is going to dive into the fellow 's guts and fetch out his gold heart ! ” Her hearers shuddered as she carried out her gruesome purpose , remarking with a hideous laugh : “ Why should I be scared of the good man ? we 're old acquaintances , we are ... I was the one packed him in down there ! ” Meantime the old harridan had deposited the strongbox at the feet of the man she too supposed to be Fantômas . Whereupon the apaches quickly found their tongues again and all bawling at once , demanded their fees in payment of the crimes they had committed . All that remained in fact was to open the little chest . The key was in the lock and an eager and obliging volunteer in the person of “ Bull's - eye ” came forward ; the lid was raised and a mass of gold coins revealed . Fandor , more and more well pleased with the turn events were taking , had whispered to Juve : “ Let them share out the swag ! ” But the journalist said no more , assailed by a new anxiety , for Juve had taken the game into his own hands and was preparing to speak . “ By the Lord ! ” thought Fandor , “ what is he going to say ? How risky , pray God he wo n't make a hash of it ! ” Juve had drawn up his tall figure to its full height and with a sweep of the arm pushed away the apaches crowding round him ; with a sudden jerk of the knee he upset “ Bull's - eye”—this was his thanks for the man 's zeal in opening the chest — reclosed the strong box and planted his foot on the lid . “ Not so fast , ” he cried , “ hear me first , you chaps ! The money is there , and it 's good money ; you can rest assured of that , but first of all , do as I tell you . Everyone shall be paid , each according to his deserts ; you have worked for Fantômas , and Fantômas means to reward	Fandor sprang in , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , drängte , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , , a , , a , , a , , , a , , a , , , , a , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
things . Over in Europe millions of men were organized in armies , engaged in slaughtering one another . That , of course , was , very terrible , but what was the good of thinking about it ? There was no way to stop it , and it certainly was n't Peter 's fault . But this poor , deluded child was acting all the time as if she were to blame for this European conflict , and had the job of bringing it to a close . The tears would come into her deep - set grey eyes , and her soft chin would quiver with pain whenever she talked about it ; and it seemed to Peter she was talking about it all the time . It was her idea that the war must be stopped by uprisings on the part of the working people in Europe . Apparently she thought this might be hastened if the working people of American City would rise up and set an example ! Section 15 Jennie talked about this plan quite openly ; she would put a red ribbon in her hair , and pin a red badge on her bosom , and go into meeting - places and sell little pamphlets with red covers . So , of course , it would be Peter 's duty to report her to the head of the secret service of the Traction Trust . Peter regretted this , and was ashamed of having to do it ; she was a nice little girl , and pretty , too , and a fellow might have had some fun with her if she had not been in such a hysterical state . He would sit and look at her , as she sat bent over her typewriter . She had soft , fluffy hair , the color of twilight , and even white teeth , and a faint flush that came and went in her cheeks -- yes , she would not be bad looking at all , if only she would straighten up , and spend a little time on her looks , as other girls did . But no , she was always in a tension , and the devil of it was , she was trying to get Peter into the same state . She was absolutely determined that Peter must get wrought up over the wrongs of the working classes . She took it for granted that he would , when he was instructed . She would tell him harrowing stories , and it was his duty to be duly harrowed ; he must be continually acting an emotional part . She would give him some of her “ literature ” to read , and then she would pin him down and make sure that he had read it . He knew how to read -- Pericles Priam had seen to that , because he wanted him to attend to	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
over and over again : “ Stick it out , Peter ; stick it out ! ” He flung out his hands and started toward his accuser . “ Mr. Guffey , as God is my witness , I do n't know a thing about it but what I 've told you . That 's what happened , and if Joe Angell tells you anything different he 's lying . ” “ But why should he lie ? ” “ I do n't know why ; I do n't know anything about it ! ” Here was where Peter reaped the advantage of his lifelong training as an intriguer . In the midst of all his fright and his despair , Peter 's subconscious mind was working , thinking of schemes . “ Maybe Angell was framing something up on you ! Maybe he was fixing some plan of his own , and I come along and spoiled it ; I sprung it too soon . But I tell you it 's straight goods I 've given you . ” And Peter 's very anguish gave him the vehemence to check Guffey 's certainty . As he rushed on , Peter could read in the eyes of the detective that he was n't really as sure as he talked . “ Did you see that suit - case ? ” he demanded . “ No , I did n't see no suit - case ! ” answered Peter . “ I do n't even know if there was a suit - case . I only know I heard Joe Angell say ` suit - case , ' and I heard him say ` dynamite . ' ” “ Did you see anybody writing anything in the place ? ” “ No , I did n't , ” said Peter . “ But I seen Henderson sitting at the table working at some papers he had in his pocket , and I seen him tear something up and throw it into the trash - basket . ” Peter saw the others look at one another , and he knew that he was beginning to make headway . A moment later came a diversion that helped to save him . The telephone rang , and the Chief of Police answered and nodded to Guffey , who came and took the receiver . “ A book ? ” he cried , with excitement in his tone . “ What sort of a plan ? Well , tell one of your men to take the car and bring that book and the plan here to the chief 's office as quick as he can move ; do n't lose a moment , everything may depend on it . ” And then Guffey turned to the others . “ He says they found a book on sabotage in the book - case , and in it there 's some kind of a drawing of a	” “ , ” he cried , “ n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ n't , ” he said , “ ” ” he said , “ ” ” he said , “ n't know , ” he said , “ n't know , ” he said .
"but more spasmodic -- the sound a leathery , sickening tattoo . It will probably be remembered that the angel had held the demon with her right hand . I was now on the angel 's right ; and , stretched out on the rock , I reached down over the edge in an effort to free her from that dragging monster , the black depths over which we hung turning me dizzy and faint .

Called by her mother , the little fair - haired girl , who played so happily with the baby , left her game and , placing her charge carefully on the bed , set out six earthen bowls on the plain boarded table , which took up most of the space in the middle of the little room , and summoned the family to supper . Not until everyone was seated did Mistress Pullen lift the great iron pot off the hook on the chimney beam and , resting it on the edge of the table , dole out to each person an allowance , which varied in quantity according to age . In the same way she distributed chunks of coarse home - made bread , and then seeing everyone served , finally she sat down to her own meal . The Pullens ate without speaking , quickly , noisily , and with evident relish , dipping the bread in the broth and eating the sodden lumps with their fingers . Mistress Amy held the baby on her lap , feeding the little creature with sops from her own bowl . When all the broth had been disposed of , more bread and an earthen jar of honey were brought out and the meal continued . Inside the little kitchen all was warm , one might almost say stuffy , for , in spite of the big fire and the number of people inside , the door was shut fast and the one little window which the room possessed was not made to open . However , the noise that the rain , swiftly driven over the marshlands by a fierce wind , made on the glass , and the hissing drops that descended the wide chimney , all helped to make the kitchen as desirable as it could be . “ Joan Bellamie was a - saying that the Captain of the _ Coldlight _ hath come back to the Ship , Joseph . Have ye heard aught of it ? ” Mistress Pullen looked across the table at her husband as she spoke . Joe dropped his eyes before her gaze . “ Oh , yes , ” he said casually . “ Oh , yes , indeed ! ” Amy 's voice rose again , “ and ye did not think to tell me , did ye ? Here I work the live - long day , and you so surly that you will not tell me the common gossip of the Island ! I 'd like to meet another woman who 'd rest with ye . ” Then she added more quietly . “ Did any of his crew return with him , perchance ? ” Joe shifted uneasily in his chair ,	“ Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh !
"yard . The sweet smell of the new butter and buttermilk hung about the kitchen door . Ten years of indefatigable energy , of clearing land , breaking soil , raising crops and rearing cattle , doing battle with the wilderness , overcoming all the hardships and odds that a pioneer has to struggle against , had left their mark on Donald Cameron . Every line in his face was ploughed deep . His expression , gloomy and taciturn as of old , masked an internal concentration , the bending of all faculties to the one end that occupied him . Always a man of few words , as the farm grew and its operations increased , he became more and more silent , talking only when it was necessary and seldom for the sake of companionship or mere social intercourse . His mind was always busy with the movements of cattle , branding , mustering , breeding , buying and selling prices , possibilities of the market . He worked insatiably . He was reminded of the flight of time only by the growth of his son -- a gawky , long - limbed boy . As soon as he could walk Davey had taken his share in the work of the homestead , rounding up cows in the early morning , feeding fowls , hunting for eggs in the ripening crops , scaring birds from the ploughed land when seed was in , and cutting ferns for the cowsheds and stables . His father was little more than a dour taskmaster to the boy . Davey had no memory of hearing him sing the gathering song of the Clan of Donald the Black . His mother had taught him to read and count as she sat with her spinning wheel in the little garden in front of the house , or stitching by the fire indoors on winter evenings . Davey had to sit near her and spell out the words slowly from the Bible or the only other book she had , a shabby little red history . Sometimes when he was tired of reading , or the click and purr of her wheel set her mind wandering , she told him stories of the country over the sea where she was born . Davey knew that the song she sang sometimes when she was spinning was a song a fairy had taught a Welshwoman long ago so that her spinning would go well and quickly . She told him stories of the tylwyth teg -- the little brown Welsh fairies . There was one he was never tired of hearing .

They do n't know what a hold they 've got on the mobs of the discontented ! ” Peter went on to tell in detail about the propaganda of social revolution , and about conspiracies against law and order , and the property and even the lives of the rich . Peter noticed that when the old man took a sip of water his hand trembled so that he could hardly keep the water from spilling ; and presently , when the phone rang again , his voice became shrill and imperious . “ I understand they 're applying for bail for those men . Now Angus , that 's an outrage ! We 'll not hear to anything like that ! I want you to see the judge at once , and make absolutely certain that those men are held in jail . ” Then again the old banker had a coughing fit . “ Now , Gudge , ” he said , “ I know more or less about all that . What I want to know is about this conspiracy against me . Tell me how you came to find out about it . ” And Peter told ; but of course he embellished it , in so far as it related to Mr. Ackerman -- these fellows were talking about Mr. Ackerman all the time , they had a special grudge against him . “ But why ? ” cried the old man . “ Why ? ” “ They think you 're fighting them , Mr. Ackerman . ” “ But I 'm not !

Why-- ” But the old man fell to coughing and became so exhausted that he sank back into his pillows until he recovered his breath . Peter waited respectfully ; but of course he was n't fooled . Peter had carried on bargaining many times in his life , and had heard people proclaim their poverty and impotence . “ Now , Gudge , ” the old man resumed . “ I do n't want to be killed ; I tell you I do n't want to be killed . ” “ No , of course not , ” said Peter .

murder . I looked for it myself and , on finding it , left it there . Miss Ballau , you will remember , testified she had lost the key some weeks before . Which explained why she had to ring the bell to get in . ” “ These things are hardly sufficient for the arrest of Miss Ballau , ” De Medici said quietly as the detective paused . “ I quite agree , ” said Norton . “ All this was evidence we had within two days of the murder . We did n't act on it but continued our hunt for more . More was necessary and we waited till we got it . ” De Medici nodded . “ The motive , for instance , ” smiled Norton . “ Well , three days after the inquest , or two days , I think , Miss Ballau disappeared . We had been watching her closely but she managed to elude us . I put two of my best men in pursuit of her and I devoted my own time to finding out her history . I was able to discover through documents and inquiry that Florence Ballau was not Victor Ballau 's daughter but his stepdaughter . She was a year old when Ballau married her mother in London . As you see , this supplies the beginnings of a motive . ” Through De Medici 's mind passed a suddenly illuminated memory of Victor Ballau — the Ballau whose fingers had trembled as he poured the liqueur that night , whose eyes had turned away as he toasted the happiness of his prospective son - in - law . His heart grew heavy as the innuendo of the lieutenant unfolded its logical terminations before him . “ We would like to have your theory of the motive , ” Dr. Lytton prompted the smiling detective . “ Motives , of course , are always more interesting and more important than clews . ” “ You were to be married , ” Norton resumed , turning to De Medici . “ And Ballau was jealous . ” “ I see , ” murmured De Medici . He sat staring at the man . Words suddenly danced excitedly in his head . “ The thing is mad , ” he cried . “ You 've let a preposterous notion run away with you .... ” Dr. Lytton 's arm reached toward his friend . “ We 've come here to listen , not to argue , ” he cautioned . “ Pardon me , ” De Medici sighed . His face resumed its mask of calm and interest . “ Certainly , ” Norton answered . “ I 'm sorry to go into this . But there 's nothing to be gained now by not facing the facts . ” “ Quite right , ” Dr. Lytton smiled . “ The facts are what we want	” De Medici paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , ” Medici , sat , sat , he sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , sat , and he sat down , he sat down .
rough - neck come through the garden . ” Somebody inside the house answered , “ What 's that you say , Anna ? ” Sard called to the man , “ There 's a rough - neck murdered Mr. Davis ; I 've got to break it to the widow . ” “ Stop him , George , ” the woman said . The man tried to stop him , and got one on the jaw which he remembered for a long time . Sard got out into a road which led quite clear of the houses into the wilderness of the foothills . There was a sort of trail leading up the hill , through a sparsely - grown jungle of brushwood . He took his chance of snakes and dodged into the brush and zigzagged through it , keeping uphill all the time . At the top of the cañon , half a mile from the town , he stopped for a moment , but he heard people as well as dogs , so he set off downhill into a gully . At the foot of the gully there were great rocks among which a little river ran . He ran upstream in the water for about a hundred yards , so as to puzzle the dogs , and then scrambled out of the water up a great rock . At the top of the rock there was a recess filled with dry sand and screened by boulders . In the sand were the fresh footprints of a wild cat , but Sard judged that wild cats are less dangerous than men , and flung himself down to get his breath . In a couple of minutes he heard the dogs at the water , and the voices of men , encouraging the dogs to hunt . He judged that there were at least eight men up with the hounds , and others joined them . He could hear their conversation as they walked up and down , and poked among the rocks . “ He 's the silver bandit who broke gaol at the barracks this afternoon . ” Another said , “ He nearly killed Hanssen at the Palace . ” Another said , “ Mother Hanssen reckon she hit him with one of her shots ; leastways there was blood under that wall . ” Another said , “ He took to the water all right , but these dogs do n't seem to get the scent any . ” Another said , “ Well , he must have gone upstream , because if he 'd gone downstream , they would have got him . ” Another said , “ He ca n't have much breath left in him , the clip he has been going . Like as not he 's got in among these rocks here ; maybe he 's listening all the time we 're talking . ” Another said ,	” he said , “ he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's a man , he 's , ” he said , “ ” he 's , he 's n't , ” he said , “ he 's n't , ” he said , “ he 's n't , ” he said , “ he 's n't got n't , ” he said , “ he 's n't got , ” he said , “ he 's ” he said , “ he 's ” he said , “ he 's ” he said , “ he 's , ” he said , “ he 's n't ” he said , “ ” he 's , ” he said , “ he 's , ” he said , “ he 's , ” he said , “ he 's n't got n't ” he said , “ he 's n't got n't ” he said , “ he 's ” he said , “ he 's n't got n't ” he said , “ he 's n't got n't ” he said , “ he 's n't got ” he said .
the fireflies glowed and went out , now as many as stars , now few , now like sparks , but always beautiful . Just beyond them was the broad sea - beach , with the breakers only fifty yards away . The sea was coming in , as it will in a shallow bay , in half - a - dozen long lines , each glowing with mild fire , shining as it neared the sand , then flashing like the moonlight , as the wave burst , then gleaming greenish , and showing the globes of the stars , as it wasted and died out upon the sand . Sard burst through the azaleas to the sands , which stretched along for a great distance right and left . To his right ( seemingly quite near ) was a shining , which he knew to be the river near Los Xicales ; beyond it , in the darkness of trees , was the house of his dream with one light burning . All a vast expanse of night , the sea - beach , the forest , and muttering water lay behind him . He rushed down to the sea and let three breakers go over him to cleanse him from the swamp and the leeches . “ Now , Sard Harker , ” he said , “ come on , port main , up with her ! ” He broke into a steady run facing to the Los Xicales light . The pine trees on the spit shut away a view of the anchorage so that he could not see the _ Pathfinder _ ; he could only hope and put his best leg foremost . “ Upon them that _ hope _ , ” he thought , “ is His mercy . ” He ran at his steady pace which , as he knew , he could keep for miles . Though it seemed so near , that shining on the sands , which he knew to be the river , was a full half - mile away . Before he had gone three hundred yards of it , he saw that the sand just ahead of him was darker and shinier than the sand under his feet . A memory of another dangerous sand , far away on an English sea - coast , shot into his mind on the instant , but the footing failed before he could stop . The sand gave beneath the one foot and let in the other : ooze of water shot up to the surface : he flung himself backwards violently , and got out , but fell , and saw , or thought that he saw , the surface of the sand shaking as though it were laughing at him . He rolled himself clear , then rose and looked at it . “ That 's a pretty bad quicksand , ” he said . “ I	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
nodded , and the aunt continued : “ Now I thought Florence just said that — that about Mr. Warren being killed , because she was mad over something . She would not have meant it , would she ? ” Her eyes met the chief 's imploringly . He shifted his heavy weight and then with a sheepish expression remarked : “ No — but then , Mrs. West , why did she take her suit case and say she was not coming back ? Where did she go ? That 's what I want to know . ” To this the woman could give no reply . There was no doubt she was very much puzzled over what had happened to her niece . But at the same time she was sure the girl was all right . As to any place that she might have gone , she did not know . She added that her niece was a girl who did not go out , as she put it , very much , and that she had no idea where she might be . We were just on the verge of leaving when I asked her if she knew of any young man she went around with . Her reply was that Florence did not care much for young men ; but in a moment she mentioned a Robert Hunt with whom she once in a while went to dances . At the name I shot a glance at the chief to see if he knew the man . He nodded . “ I know him . That 's the young man who is studying law in Judge Thompson 's law office . A fine young fellow . ” The aunt informed us that occasionally the young man came to the house to see Florence and took her to dances . But he seemed to be the only young man with whom the girl had anything to do , for the old lady could not think of any other person the girl had been interested in , and with this we left . I dropped the chief in front of Carter 's . Leaving the car in the drive , I went into the house to be greeted by the two men with the news that lunch was ready . As we went into the dining room , they asked me how I felt after my night 's escapade , and grinned a little when I told them I was a little sore . Then as we seated ourselves at the table , I told them of the visit of the chief and of the finding of the dagger . They made hardly any comment , though Ranville said he wanted to have a look at the weapon . During the lunch they told me about the funeral . Not only had it been largely attended , but there had never been so many famous men	Während ich sah , daß es sich um einen jungen Mann handelte , und daß er es nicht wünschte, daß er es wünschte, daß er es wünschte, daß er es wünschte, daß er es wünschte, daß er es wün , wün , wün , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es , es .
neat and fastidious about her person . She was for ever heating kettles and pans of water for bathing , for washing stockings and handkerchiefs . She had a knack with the needle and could devise a quite plausible third - act ball gown out of a length of satin , some limp tulle , and a yard or two of tinsel . She never read . Her industry irked Julie as Julie 's indolence irritated her . Elly was something of a shrew ( Schultzy had learned to his sorrow that your blue - eyed blondes are not always doves ) . “ Pity 's sake , Julie , how you can sit there doing nothing , staring out at that everlasting river 's more than I can see . I should think you 'd go plumb crazy . ” “ What would you have me do ? ” “ Do ! Mend the hole in your stocking , for one thing . ” “ I should say as much , ” Mrs. Hawks would agree , if she chanced to be present . She had no love for Elly ; but her own passion for industry and order could not but cause her to approve a like trait in another . Julie would glance down disinterestedly at her long slim foot in its shabby shoe . “ Is there a hole in my stocking ? ” “ You know perfectly well there is , Julie Dozier . You must have seen it the size of a half dollar when you put it on this morning . It was there yesterday , same 's to - day . ” Julie smiled charmingly . “ I know . I declare to goodness I hoped it would n't be . When I woke up this morning I thought maybe the good fairies would have darned it up neat 's a pin while I slept . ” Julie 's voice was as indolent as Julie herself . She spoke with a Southern drawl . Her I was Ah . Ah declah to goodness — or approximately that . Magnolia would smile in appreciation of Julie 's gentle raillery . She adored Julie . She thought Elly , with her fair skin and china - blue eyes , as beautiful as a princess in a fairy tale , as was natural in a child of her sallow colouring and straight black hair . But the two were antipathetic . Elly , in ill - tempered moments , had been known to speak of Magnolia as “ that brat , ” though her vanity was fed by the child 's admiration of her beauty . But she never allowed her to dress up in her discarded stage finery , as Julie often did . Elly openly considered herself a gifted actress whose talent and beauty were , thanks to her shiftless husband , pearls cast before the river - town swinery .

Ravenal , surveying the furrowed brow , the unshaven cheeks , the careless dress , the lack - lustre eye , had involuntarily allowed to creep into his tone something of the astonishment he felt . Schultzy made a little deprecating gesture with his hands , his shoulders . “ I guess I do n't look like no juvenile lead , and that 's a fact . But I 'm all shot to pieces . Took a drink the size of this”—indicating perhaps five fingers—“up yonder on Canal Street ; straight whisky . No drinking allowed on the show boat .

He turned away abruptly , without a good - bye , went perhaps ten paces , came back five and called to Ravenal . “ You ever acted ? ” “ Acted ! ” “ On the stage . Acted .

At this point where we struck it , the water was deep , the current a gentle one . The rich forest growth hung out over the surface for some distance .

This and the faint , melancholy whisper of the gliding element were all that broke the heavy , deathlike stillness . It was a placid , a lovely scene .

"grandmother , my child , """""""" said the woman , a smile rare in its peace and beauty breaking over her drawn countenance . CHAPTER XVI ANOTHER BLOW DESCENDS The ride home from Belleport was a subdued one , bringing to an afternoon that had been rich in sunshine a climax of shadow . The Galbraiths were far too stunned by the startling revelations of the day to wish to prolong a meeting that had lapsed into awkwardness , and until they had had opportunity to readjust themselves they were eager to be alone ; nor did their delicacy of perception fail to detect a similar craving in the minds of their guests . Therefore they did not press their visitors to remain and tactfully arranged that one of the servants instead of Roger should drive the Spences back over the Harbor Road . As the motor purred its way along , there was little conversation . Even had not the chauffeur 's presence acted as a restraint , none of the party would have had the heart to make perfunctory conversation ; the tragedy of the moment had touched them too deeply . What a strange , wonderful unraveling of life 's tangled skeins had come with the few fleeting hours . Each turned the drama over in his mind , trying to make a reality of it and spin into the warp and woof of the tapestry time had already woven this thread of new color . But so startling was it in hue that it refused to blend , standing out against the duller tones of the past with appalling distinctness ; and never was it more irreconcilable than when the familiar confines of the little fishing hamlet by the sea were reached and those who struggled to harmonize it saw it in contrast with this background of simplicity . Each silently reconstructed Delight 's life , now linking it with its ancestry and its romantic beginnings . She had , then , sprung from aristocratic stock ; riches had been her right , and culture her heritage . She had been the single flower of a passionate love , and the hot - headed young father to whom she had been bequeathed when bereft of the woman he had adored had taken her with him when he had sought the sea 's balm to assuage his sorrow . She was all that remained of that tender , throbbing memory of his youth . Where he went she followed , all unconscious of peril and with youth 's God - given faith ; and when the great moment came and the supreme sacrifice was demanded , the man voluntarily severed the bonds that bound them , leaving her to life while he himself went forth into the Beyond . What must not that heroic soul have suffered when he cast his child into the ocean 's arms and upon the mercies of an unknown future !

from her , ” he mused , “ as if I were sick and bewildered for some place to go .... ” Then his musings returned to her father . Yes , a curious man . A background of tapestries , rare books , antique collections and a chattering circle of poets , dancers , painters , connoisseurs . A quixotic fancy for the theater , he had achieved distinction out of his failures , producing deftly written comedies of manners and dramas of mood that never ran . Yet the theater with its rigmarole of intrigue , gamble , women and craftsmanship was another part of Ballau 's background . But an exterior Ballau , he mused . There was something else about the man , and this thing whispered itself always to De Medici 's sensitive imagination . This man of the theater whose apartment was the haunt of a Sybarite , whose cavalierly manner was the envy of a hundred bon vivants , was , paradoxically , a puritan . A charming and unmalicious puritan . “ A man of taste , ” thought De Medici , “ wealthy and with an infatuation for beautiful things .... I 've seen him rave before a Titian ... yet no women . Intrigues shadow him . Beauties pursue him . And still he remains a baffling and graceful Galahad where one looks with certainty for a Don Juan . It would be hard for him to dissemble — surrounded by so avid a pack of scandalmongers . ” De Medici nodded to himself . There was something else about Ballau — the quality toward which his own peculiar nature responded always with readiness . Secrecy — veiled things that lurked behind the smiles of men and women , furtive lights that came to their eyes when they grew silent ... he had felt this quality in Ballau . It had , in fact , precipitated their comradeship . His thought could place no words on it , but his intuitions led him toward a mystery — an unknown Ballau , a jealously guarded stranger who lived a secret life behind the debonair and gentle exterior of the man he knew . “ I 've been thinking it over , ” Ballau began talking as he reëntered the room carrying bottle and glasses on a tray , “ and I 'll supplement my advice , Julien . Let the minor details adjust themselves . If you 're in love with Florence , the thing to do , I fancy , is to tell her so . ” He seemed flushed as he placed the tray on a table . He was smiling , but De Medici noticed that his fingers trembled . “ Love , ” the older man continued , “ is a rare and everlasting flower .... ” He paused and closed his eyes . De Medici noted the darkening pain that passed over his features . Ballau	” De Medici rentered the room , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , paused , he , Medici .

, glass - enclosed pilot house high above the rest of the boat and reached by the ultimate flight of steep narrow stairs . From this vantage point you saw the turbulent flood of the Mississippi , a vast yellow expanse , spread before you and all around you ; for ever rushing ahead of you , no matter how fast you travelled ; sometimes whirling about in its own tracks to turn and taunt you with your unwieldy ponderosity ; then leaping on again . Sometimes the waters widened like a sea so that one could not discern the dim shadow of the farther shore ; again they narrowed , snake - like , crawling so craftily that the side - wheeler boomed through the chutes with the willows brushing the decks . You never knew what lay ahead of you — that is , Magnolia never knew . That was part of the fascination of it . The river curved and twisted and turned and doubled . Mystery always lay just around the corner of the next bend . But her father knew . And Mr. Pepper , the chief pilot , always knew . You could n't believe that it was possible for any human brain to remember the things that Captain Andy and Mr. Pepper knew about that treacherous , shifting , baffling river . Magnolia delighted to test them . She played a game with Mr. Pepper and with her father , thus : “ What 's next ? ” “ Kinney 's woodpile . ” “ Now what ? ” “ Ealer 's Bend . ” “ What 'll be there , when we come round that corner ? ” “ Patrie 's Plantation . ” “ What 's around that bend ? ” “ An old cottonwood with one limb hanging down , struck by lightning . ” “ What 's coming now ? ” “ A stump sticking out of the water at Higgin 's Point . ” They always were right . It was magic . It was incredible . They knew , too , the depth of the water . They could point out a spot and say , “ That used to be an island — Buckle 's Island . ” “ But it 's water ! It could n't be an island . It 's water . We're — why , we 're riding on it now . ” Mr. Pepper would persist , unmoved . “ Used to be an island . ” Or , pointing again , “ Two years ago I took her right down through there where that point lays . ” “ But it 's dry land . You 're just fooling , are n't you , Mr. Pepper ? Because you could n't take a boat on dry land . It 's got things growing on it ! Little trees , even . So how could you ? ” “ Water there	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Sir , forgive my asking , but have you a little bit of tobacco or a god - dam cigarette ? ” “ No , ” Sard said , “ I have not . ” “ What do you want here , sir ? ” the man asked . “ What do you come to this house for ? This is General Martinez ' house . ” “ So I understand , ” Sard said . “ I want to know the name of the lady who came to this house to - day . ” “ Oh , Lord , are you American ? ” “ No . ” “ I thought you were an American , because you talked such funny language . ” “ What is the name of the lady ? ” “ There is no lady here , sir ; the lady died a hundred years ago . Oh , say , the lovely yellow candles , and the priest he go Do diddy diddy oh do . ” “ Then there is no lady ? ” “ All put into the grave : ring a bell : Do . ” “ Is anyone at the house at all ? ” “ All in the grave . Do . Ring the bell . Do . ” A square - faced man , riding sideways on a heavily - laden mule , stopped in the road . “ Sir , ” he said to Sard , “ can I be of service to you ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” Sard said . “ Can you tell me if any Spanish lady came , or is coming , to this house to - day ? ” “ The house is shut up , sir . No one will come to this house for some weeks . I , who am Paco , know this , since I have this day talked with Ramón , the caretaker of the General . It may be that in some weeks ' time , when the English , who are to be here , have come , Tio Ramón may know more . ” Sard thanked him and walked on ; he came to a little bridge over the river , crossed it , and continued through the forest for half a mile , when he came to a cleared patch where a forge stood beside the road with an inn ( of sorts ) alongside it . Here a grey old Italian , who said that his name was Enobbio , confirmed what Paco had said : the house of Los Xicales was shut up , in the care of Tio Ramón and his wife Eusebia : no visitor would come there for some weeks . Sard thanked him and returned to his ship . “ There it is , ” he said , when he stood once more in	” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” 
pursuing journalist . The pace was hot . It was plain that Fantômas ' man of business was bent on completing before daylight whatever the job it was he had made up his mind to do . But to manage it he must make all possible haste , for , as Moche had noted , it was by now three o'clock in the morning . “ God Almighty ! ” Fandor swore , pressing on harder still , “ what a racer the scoundrel is ! ... Where are we ? We 're clean through Alfort , and there 's nothing else but that hovel ahead there ; it looks deserted , but it 's that way and nowhere else Moche is making across country . Ah , ha ! I think I 'm going to know ! ” Moche , in fact , was making straight for a tumble - down building that stood empty and abandoned in the middle of a wide stretch of waste ground , its shutters hanging from their hinges , its walls dropping to pieces , and a general look of poverty - stricken dilapidation brooding over all . Like a person familiar with the locality and having a perfect right to march in without knocking , he pushed open the door , a strong and heavy one . Still , the idea occurred to him that tramps might have taken refuge in the ramshackle hut for shelter from the cold out of doors ; so he took his revolver in hand , and in he went . The old usurer reclosed the door behind him ; then Fandor , who had been crouching to the ground , advanced with a thousand precautions , glued his ear to the door , made certain that the outermost room was unoccupied , and opening in his turn , made his way silently into the lonely house . Neither did he fail to hold his trusty Browning ready for action . At first he had some difficulty in making out just where Moche could be , but soon , noticing a feeble , almost imperceptible glimmer of light that filtered up through the floor , he realized that the old usurer was in a cellar , and had pulled to after him the trap - door by which he had gained access . Fandor threw himself flat on the trap - door in question and peeped through the cracks between the boards . But what he saw went far beyond anything he had expected . By the light of a lantern he had unhooked from the wall Moche , having first deposited his precious money - chest on the floor , was busy raising with infinite caution one of the paving - stones in the north corner of the cellar . “ Evidently , ” the journalist thought to himself , “ he wants to re - bury his treasure in a new place ! ” And	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

However , no such calamity occurred . He drank his tea with satisfaction and was presently borne off by Mr. Galbraith to inspect a recently purchased barometer . After he had gone the company broke up into little groups . Mrs. Galbraith and Celestina betook themselves to a shaded corner , there to exchange felicitations on Miss Morton 's nephew ; Roger , Cynthia , and Bob perched on the broad piazza rail and discussed the recent boat race ; and Madam Lee was left alone with Delight . Robert Morton looked in vain for Mr. Snelling but he was nowhere to be seen , and presently he learned that that gentleman had taken one of the cars and gone for an afternoon 's spin to Sawyer 's Falls . Whether his absence was a contributory cause or not , certain it was that for the time being at least Cynthia lapsed into her customary friendly manner and quite outdid herself in graciousness . Bob relaxed his tension . The afternoon was moving on with more serenity than he had dared hope , and inwardly he began to congratulate himself on the success of it . To judge from appearance every one was in the serenest frame of mind . Willie was beaming into his host 's face , and both men were laughing immoderately ; Celestina , from the snatches of conversation that reached him , was relating for Mrs. Galbraith 's benefit the symptoms of her late illness ; and Madam Lee was chatting with Delight as with an old - time friend . Bob longed to join them , but prudence forbade his leaving Cynthia 's side . Moreover he suspected the tête - à - tête was of the old lady 's arranging and he dared not break in on it . If Madam Lee desired his presence , she was quite capable of commanding it by one of those characteristically imperious waves of her hand . But she did not summon him .

to hide in the trees of the garden . Peter cowered , and listened to the furious uproar , and presently he heard the cries of those on top of him , and realized that they were being pulled off and clubbed ; he felt hands reach down and grab him , and he cringed and cried in terror ; but nothing happened to him , and presently he glanced up and he saw a man wearing a black mask , but easily to be recognized as McGivney . Never in all his life had Peter been gladder to see a human face than he was to see that masked face of a rat ! McGivney had a club in his hand , and was dealing ferocious blows to the clothes heaped around Peter . Behind McGivney were Hammett and Cummings , covering the proceedings , and now and then carefully putting in a blow of their own . Most of the fighting inside the house and outside came quickly to an end , because everybody who fought was laid out or overpowered . Then several of the agents of Guffey , who had been studying these Reds for a year or two and knew them all , went about picking out the ones who were especially wanted , and searching them for arms , and then handcuffing them . One of these men approached Peter , who instantly fell unconscious , and closed his eyes ; then Hammett caught him under the armpits and Cummings by the feet , and McGivney walked alongside as a bodyguard , remarking now and then , “ We want this fellow , we 'll take care of him . ” They carried Peter outside , and in the darkness he opened his eyes just enough to see that the street was lined with automobiles , and that the Reds were being loaded aboard . Peter 's friends carried him to one car and drove him away , and then Peter returned to consciousness , and the four of them sat up and laughed to split their sides , and slapped one another on the back , and mentioned the satisfactory things they had seen . Had Hammett noticed that slice Grady had got over the eyes , and the way the blood had run all over him ? Well , he wanted to be a Red -- they had helped him be one -- inside and out ! Had McGivney noticed how “ Buck ” Ellis , one of their men , had put the nose of the hobo poet out of joint ? And young Ogden , son of the president of the Chamber of Commerce , had certainly managed to show how he felt about these cattle , the female ones as well as the males ; when that Yankovich slut had slapped his face , he had caught her by the breasts and nearly twisted them off , and she	McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGivney , McGi

keep it from dropping off , though hers were the large - knuckled fingers of the generous and resourceful nature . It was to see much of life , that ring . She longed to say to him , “ Where do you belong , Gay ? Who are you ? Do n't tell me you 're a Ravenal . That is n't a profession , is it ? You ca n't live on that . ” But she knew it was useless . There was a strange deep streak of the secretive in him ; baffling , mystifying . Questioned , he would say nothing . It was not a moody silence , or a resentful one . He simply would not speak . She had learned not to ask . “ We ca n't go away now , Gay dear . I ca n't go . You do n't want to go without me , do you ? You would n't leave me ! Maybe next winter , after the boat 's put up , we can go to St. Louis , or even New Orleans — that would be nice , would n't it ? The winter in New Orleans . ” One of his silences . He never had any money — that is , he never had it for long . It vanished . He would have one hundred dollars . He would go ashore at some sizable town and return with five hundred — a thousand . “ Got into a little game with some of the boys , ” he would explain , cheerfully . And give her three hundred of it , four hundred , five . “ Buy yourself a dress , Nola . Something rich , with a hat to match . You 're too pretty to wear those homemade things you 're always messing with . ” Some woman wisdom in her told her to put by a portion of these sums . She got into the habit of tucking away ten dollars , twenty , fifty . At times she reproached herself for this ; called it disloyal , sneaking , underhand . When she heard him say , as he frequently did , “ I 'm strapped . If I had fifty dollars I could turn a trick that would make five hundred out of it . You have n't got fifty , have you , Nola ? No , of course not . ” She wanted then to give him every cent of her tiny hoard . It was the tenuous strain of her mother in her , doubtless — the pale thread of the Parthy in her make - up — that caused her to listen to an inner voice . “ Do n't do it , ” whispered the voice , nudging her , “ keep it .

Why should I think about such things ?

Why do n't you care for me ? ” She looked up at him , and their eyes met , and with a little sob in her voice she answered , “ I 'm not well , Comrade Peter . I 'm of no use ; it would be wicked for me to marry . ” Somewhere back in the depths of Peter , where his inner self was crouching , it was as if a sudden douche of ice - cold water were let down on him . “ Marry ! ” Who had said anything about marrying ? Peter 's reaction fitted the stock - phrase of the comic papers : “ This is so sudden ! ” But Peter was too clever to reveal such dismay . He humored little Jennie , saying , “ We do n't have to marry right away . I could wait , if only I knew that you cared for me ; and some day , when you get well-- ” She shook her head sadly . “ I 'm afraid I 'll never get really well . And besides , neither of us have any money , Comrade Peter . ” Ah , there it was ! Money , always money ! This “ free love ” was nothing but a dream . “ I could get a job , ” said Peter -- just like any other tame and conventional wooer . “ But you could n't earn enough for two of us , ” protested the girl ; and suddenly she sprang up . “ Oh , Comrade Peter , let 's not fall in love with each other ! Let 's not make ourselves unhappy , let 's work for the cause !

Already three times Bob Morton had lifted the mite off the table and three times back she had come , leaping in the path of his gleaming plane as if its metallic whir and glimmering reflections were designed solely for her amusement .

With a coquettish leap headlong into the sunshine darted Jezebel , only to come suddenly into collision with a stranger who had crossed the grass and was at that instant about to enter the workshop . The newcomer was a girl , tall and slender , with lustrous masses of dark hair that swept her cheek in wind - tossed ringlets . She had a complexion vivid with health , an undignified little nose and a mouth whose short upper lip lent to her face a half childish , half pouting expression .

who might have killed Warren . ” The telephone bell interrupted him . It was a long , incessant ring . I went into the hall , and in a moment there came the voice of the chief asking for Bartley . Telling him to wait , I returned to the living room and said that the chief was calling . With a half smile Bartley rose to his feet and went out into the hall . We heard the low murmur of his voice , and the conversation was rather long . When it ceased , he came slowly back and dropped into a chair . There was a rather perplexed look on his face as he turned to us . “ The chief called up to tell me he has succeeded in getting the gardener to talk . And the chief , I might add , although he promised to let the man go , has decided to hold him longer . ” “ What for ? ” we both cried . “ Well , ” came the slow reply , “ the gardener says that he was asked to go into Warren 's library and take one of those three caskets which I noticed on the stands . He was to take the one nearest the safe ; for doing this he would receive one hundred dollars . ” “ Who asked him to do that ? ” came Ranville 's eager question . Bartley shrugged his shoulders in a gesture which might express anything . “ He says your Chinese visitor was the one who made the proposal . ” Chapter XII The Chinaman Reappears We did not speak for a moment . Bartley 's statement had been so unexpected that I saw a rather questioning look pass over Ranville 's face . Though I had been surprised to discover that the man who had looked through the library window was the gardener , yet I had not thought there was anything suspicious in his action . His explanation , that he had seen the light in the building and had gone to see who was within , had sounded reasonable . The dull , stolid type of man he was seemed to make it impossible there could be any real motive in his trying to escape . A look at both Bartley and Ranville told me they had a different opinion . That the gardener had been asked by the Chinaman who had visited us to take one of the small caskets from the library was a rather startling piece of information . Perhaps it was even more — that bit of luck which Bartley said might lead to the solving of the mystery . Just as I was about to say this , Ranville spoke : “ Looks to me as though we had better run up to the library again . ” Bartley nodded , and as we rose to go out into	” Bartley shook his head . ” Bartley shook his head . ” Bartley shook his head . ” Bartley shook his head . ” Bartley shook his head .
"him . It was that stern righteousness of his , his sober , stolid virtue , which had given Cameron the place in the respect and grudging homage of the countryside that his wealth and property alone would not have won for him ; they had cloaked even his meanness with a sombre dignity and brought him the half - jesting title of the Laird of Ayrmuir . Davey led his horse into the paddock beside the church where the vehicles which had brought the hill folk to the township were standing . The horses out of the shafts , their heavy harness still on their backs , were feeding , tethered to the fence , or to the wheels of the carts and buggies . He stood beside the high , old - fashioned buggy that had brought Mary and Donald Cameron to Wirreeford . He rubbed his hand along Bessie 's long coffin - box of a nose , and told her on a drifting stream of thought that he had decided to go home , to ask his father to forgive him , and that he meant to try to get on with him again . Her attitude of attention and affection comforted him . The people began to come from the church . They stood in groups by the doorway talking to each other . One or two men came into the paddock to harness - up for the home journey . Davey put the mare into her shafts . He was fastening the traces when Mary Cameron came round the back of the buggy .

science . Naturally enough the question was raised , if his manuscripts were in such shape that the discoveries he had hinted he made in China could be given the world . As I read the various articles , I saw that this one question was of the greatest interest to the public . Warren had said that he could prove for all time the question of man 's origin . But what his proofs were no one knew . As he was a real scientist he refused to say anything more until he had whipped his notes into shape for publication and could give the complete data to the world . And the three papers which I read all asked the same question . Were these notes in such condition that they could be worked up by some other man of science ? I was interrupted by the cook saying that dinner was ready , and I went into the dining room for my meal . Dinner over , I went out of the house , and for a time strolled around the grounds . They covered about an acre , and after a while I went through the opening in the hedge and into the quiet street . The road took a bend by Carter 's house , and around it I saw the dark gray tower of a little church . I walked far enough to be able to have a view of it , deciding that it must be the church of which his next - door neighbor ( the minister who had called the night before ) had charge . From where I stood it seemed a very pretty sort of a building , with a stone tower directly between the church and the rectory . It was not very large , nor was the tower very high . It stood back from the road , with a vivid green lawn running to the dark granite walls — a lawn with several round flower beds , a mass of color against the green . The setting of the little church was beautiful , as if some corner of England had been lifted and placed in the little New York village . I had thought I might take a little stroll , but feeling lazy I returned to the veranda , where , for a while , I busied myself with a popular magazine . I was in the midst of an inane story when I was hailed by a voice from the lawn , and the dog went barking down the steps . “ Say , mister , where is Mr. Carter ? ” It was a boy of about fourteen who hailed me — a boy with the reddest hair I have ever seen and more freckles than any boy ought to have .

the southern roads , and the carouses held there were night - long . It was recognised as a hotbed of thieves and ruffians by the roadsters , and no man of substance or any pretensions at all , would lodge the night in any of the mud - built huts within a stone 's throw of the river . Before long , the Wirree men had fat cattle to dispose of . An open space between the huts , not far from McNab 's , was used as a sale yard . It was then that settlers who wanted good prices for their beasts had to drive them to the Wirree market . A better bargain was driven in the Wirree square than anywhere else . So Wirree Ford became Wirreeford , and thrived and prospered until it was the busiest cattle market in the south . To a certain extent , its prosperity threw an air of respectability over it . At first , cattle - owners and farmers from the hills entered the township in the morning and left it before the shadows of night fell . They did their business , and left the Wirree not much better off for their coming , venturing into the shanty for a midday meal only , and drinking sparingly , if at all , of the curious , dark spirits it vended . Then stores were opened . There were less fearsome comings and goings . Mrs. Mary Ann Hegarty set up a shanty and proceeded to business with an air of great propriety . Women and children were brought into the township for the cattle sales . Sale days became weekly holidays . They meant the donning of festive ribbands by the women and children , the climbing into high spring - carts and buggies , and driving along the winding track from the hills to the township , where groceries , dress stuffs and household furnishings could be bought , and stowed in the back of the carts for the home journey . Sale days , however , still ended in gaming and drinking brawls at the shanties , and sometimes in the dropping of a heavy , still body into the Wirree , when the tides would carry it out to sea . It was the disappearance of a young farmer from the West Hills after a night at the Black Bull that made Donald Cameron decide to take action . He , backed by other farmers and well - to - do hill settlers , made representations to the Port authorities as to the lawless character and conduct of Wirreeford township . A trooper who rode into it a few days later was pelted with stones , tarred and feathered , and sent back to Port Southern . Then a building was rim - up on the outskirts of the township -- a ramshackle house built of overlapping , smooth , pine shingles .

the evening 's bill on the _ Cotton Blossom _ . “ A whole evening of that ? ” she said . Years later the Masonic Temple Roof was opened for vaudeville . “ There ! ” Ravenal had triumphantly exclaimed . “ What did I tell you ! Some of those people get three and four hundred a week , and even more . ” Here the juggling Agoust family threw plates and lighted lamps and tables and chairs and ended by keeping aloft a whole dinner service and parlour suite , with lamps , soup tureens , and plush chairs passing each other affably in midair without mishap . Jessie Bartlett Davis sang , sentimentally , Tuh - rue LOVE , That 's The Simple Charm That Opens Every Woman 's Heart . At the other end of the scale were the all - night restaurants with a stage at the rear where the waiters did an occasional song and dance , or where some amateur tried to prove his talent . Between these were two or three variety shows of decent enough reputation though frequented by the sporting world of Chicago . Chief of these was Jopper 's Varieties , a basement theatre on Wabash supposed to be copied after the Criterion in London . There was a restaurant on the ground floor . A flight of marble steps led down to the underground auditorium . Here new acts were sometimes tried out . Lillian Russell , it was said , had got her first hearing at Jopper 's . For some reason , Magnolia had her mind fixed on this place . She made straight for it , probably as unbusinesslike a performer as ever presented herself for a hearing . It was now well on toward mid - afternoon . Already the early December dusk was gathering , aided by the Chicago smoke and the lake fog . Her fright at Hetty Chilson 's door was as nothing compared to the sickening fear that filled her now . She was physically and nervously exhausted . The false energy of the morning had vanished . She tried to goad herself into fresh courage by thoughts of Kim at the convent ; of Parthy 's impending visitation . As she approached the place on Wabash she resolved not to pass it , weakly . If she passed it but once she never would have the bravery to turn and go in . She and Ravenal had driven by many times on their way to the South Side races . It was in this block . It was four doors away . It was here . She wheeled stiffly , like a soldier , and went in . The restaurant was dark and deserted . One dim light showed at the far end . The tablecloths were white patches in the grayness . But a yellow path of light flowed up the stairway that led to the basement	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .

Sard knew him at once ; indeed no one could fail to know him ; there being only one such man alive . He was a grand man , with beauty and power in every line and gesture . He was dressed in spotless white and girt with a green sash . He wore the great white Santa Barbara hat of white macilento straw . He stood still , surveying Sard , for half a minute ; Sard stood bareheaded surveying him . Very slowly and reverently the Dictator removed his hat , bowed to Sard and stood bareheaded before him . He said no word , but stood there bowed . Sard wished that it might end . The Dictator advanced suddenly and spoke in English with fierce interjections of Spanish . “ Por Dios , Captain Harker , ” he said , “ I have waited all these years , knowing that you would come . When I heard that you were ashore and at the Plaza I could hardly endure to wait . So , give me your hands : no : both hands : so : how are you ? ” Sard mumbled that he was well and glad to see the Dictator well . “ Yes , ” the Dictator said , “ I am better than when last we met . You remember the time we met , on board the _ Venturer _ ? ” “ Yes , Your Excellency . ” “ I , too , I do not forget .

Those swinery were rowing harbour - guard for me . These men in the _ Venturer _ drew me half drowned from the sea and stood between me and death . ” He paused for a moment muttering words which were customary with him when moved : some were prayers for Carlotta , the rest curses on her killers . “ Yes , ” he muttered , “ the swinery ; but they paid with their life 's blood , all but that dog , Don José , and that dog , Rafael .

By this time the rowboat had once more come to the plank across the mud . Blueneck , a shadowy figure in the darkness , stepped out and came toward them . Dick gave his orders briefly . “ Take the brig up the Pyfleet , ” he said . “ Any of these fellows will pilot thee , ” he added , pointing to the group of Mersea men on the wall . Then as an afterthought , “ and bring five kegs from the hold to me at the Ship Tavern . ” A certain amount of enthusiasm among the volunteer pilots was noticeable after this last remark , and Blueneck smiled as he replied , “ Ay , ay , Cap'n . ” Black'erchief Dick and his friend Big French , the smuggler 's carter , turned , climbed the wall , and walked together down the lonely road to the Ship Tavern without speaking . “ Marry ! ” said Dick , stopping after they had walked for some five minutes , his hand feeling for his knife . “ What 's that ? ” Big French stopped also and , standing side by side in the middle of the road , they listened intently . Apparently just behind the hedge on their right a human voice , deep and throaty , said clearly , “ Rum -- rum -- rum -- rum , ” the sound trailing off weirdly on the last word . The Spaniard crossed himself , but his hand was steady . “ Is't a spirit ? ” he said . “ Nay , ” Big French 's voice came stifled from his mouth . The Spaniard drew his knife . “ Then I 'll have at it , ” he said . Once again the stifled monosyllable broke from the younger man 's lips . Black'erchief Dick looked at his guide quickly .

. “ If any rum - runners come by this swampy bit , they 'll meet their match . ” They went warily forward , lighting themselves with their last copies of _ La Nacion _ . They met with no moccasins , but as they crossed the swampy patch by the causeway , the croaking of the bull - frogs hushed for a moment . “ This was the sort of place the Conquistadores landed in , ” Hilary said . “ Cortés landed in just such another , and burned his ships on the beach behind him . When we go down the coast , we will draw the very beach where he landed . Imagine landing like that , a thousand miles from any store , or any friend , in an unknown world . It was a lonely night for those fellows , when their ships were burned and they turned inland to what was waiting for them . ” “ I would not pity them too much , ” Margaret answered . “ They were there from choice , mainly from greed ; nor were they novices at the work . They had also three great advantages , guns , horses and Cortés . The prizes to be won were enormous , and the dangers to be faced only thirst , which was probably chronic with them ; hunger , which they must have known in Spain ; and death , which they would have had on the gallows if they had not emigrated . ” “ I see all that , ” he said ; “ yet there it is . Cortés came to the difficult new thing and did it . Then four hundred years afterwards , fellows like me appear , who write how Cortés did it and how he ought to have done it .

When you get to the living room , try and turn on the lights . Take your gun and your flashlight . ” Ranville went to his bureau , fumbled a moment in the dark , and came back to our side . He said in a low voice that he had his gun and the light . Then Bartley went over by the window . We could not see him very clearly , only as a darker shadow against the blackness . But we heard him as he took the screen out , and there came a soft scraping sound as he went out on the roof . As this died away , Ranville whispered : “ Come on , Pelt , ” and started for the door . Out in the hall we paused a moment to listen , but no sound came to our ears . With my hand against the wall I crept softly down its length until we came to the rail of the stairs which led to the first floor . Again we paused , but heard nothing . Then very carefully , one step at a time , we went down the stairs , pausing at each step to listen . We reached the bottom of the stairs without hearing anything . The hall was very wide . On the right was the great living room , which ran the entire length of the house . On the left was a dining room and a small library . The living room was directly under the room in which I slept , and the sound of the falling chair had come from there . There was a wide double door , and I knew that the doors were open . But when , after going very carefully down the hall , we reached the doorway , we discovered as we put out our hands that it was closed . This rather startled me for a second though I knew they could not be locked ; there was no kind of a lock on the door . Whoever had entered the room had closed the doors , no doubt to prevent any sound being heard . I felt Ranville 's hand as it went searching over the surface of the door and as it slid over my fingers . Then slowly I felt the door open as he pushed against it — open until we were able to slip into the room . As we paused inside the door for a second , we saw and heard nothing .

glance , and then her eyes came back to the coroner . Again he barked out : “ What did she say ? ” “ She said , ” was the slow reply , “ Mr. Warren ought to be killed . He ought to be killed . ” A murmur of astonishment went around the room , and I saw from the coroner 's face that the answer was unexpected . There had been nothing of value until the present testimony , and now , all at once , there had come into the crowded room the ringing of a threat . I saw Carter shift in his chair and he bent forward and whispered something in the Englishman 's ear . But what it was I did not know . And then after a moment of surprise the coroner tried to gain more information from his witness . But she had told him all she knew . She said the secretary had been very angry , and that her voice had risen when she made her remark “ that Warren ought to be killed . ” But why she had said this she could not tell . The girl , a moment later , had picked up her suit case and left the house . She had watched her from a front window and saw her go out to the road . Where she had gone , or the reason for her action , she did not know . And though the coroner asked her many questions yet he gained nothing in return ; for the woman knew of no reason why the secretary should have left the house or above all why she had made the remark that she did . When she left the stand there was a different atmosphere about the inquest . We had spent the morning in getting nowhere . Now all at once there had come a mystery — the mystery of why the secretary should have rushed into the house for her bag , why she had left , and , above all , the reason for her statement against her employer . In rapid succession two policemen followed one another on the stand . They testified that they had spent the morning trying to find the secretary , but to no avail . Before she had gone to Warren 's home to work she had roomed in a house kept by an aunt . But the aunt had not seen her for several days and they had found no trace of her anywhere . She simply had walked out of Warren 's yard and vanished . They told of asking the drivers of several of the bus lines if they had had the girl as a passenger . But though she was very well known in the village no one had seen her .

come to believe it ; but now he realized that it was not true , he was just as brave as anybody else in the crowd . The truth was that Peter had not had a happy time in his youth , he had never learned , like the younger members of the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants ' and Manufacturers ' Association , to knock a little white ball about a field with various shapes and sizes of clubs . Peter was like a business man who has missed his boyhood , and then in later years finds the need of recreation , and takes up some form of sport by the orders of his physician . It became Peter 's , form of sport to stick an automatic revolver in his hip - pocket , and take a blackjack in his hand , and rush into a room where thirty or forty Russians or “ Sheenies ” of all ages and lengths of beard were struggling to learn the intricacies of English spelling . Peter would give a yell , and see this crowd leap and scurry hither and thither , and chase them about and take a whack at a head wherever he saw one , and jump into a crowd who were bunched together like sheep , trying to hide their heads , and pound them over the exposed parts of their anatomy until they scattered into the open again . He liked to get a lot of them started downstairs and send them tumbling heels over head ; or if he could get them going out a window , that was more exhilarating yet , and he would yell and whoop at them . He learned some of their cries -- outlandish gibberish it was -- and he would curse them in their own language . He had a streak of the monkey in him , and as he got to know these people better he would imitate their antics and their gestures of horror , and set a whole room full of the “ bulls ” laughing to split their sides . There was a famous “ movie ” comedian with big feet , and Peter would imitate this man , and waddle up to some wretched sweat - shop worker and boot him in the trousers ' seat , or step on his toes , or maybe spit in his eye . So he became extremely popular among the “ bulls , ” and they would insist on his going everywhere with them . Later on , when the government set to work to break up the Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party , Peter 's popularity and prestige increased still more . For now , instead of just raiding and smashing , the police and detectives would round up the prisoners and arrest them by hundreds , and carry them off and put them thru “ examinations . ” And	” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ”

Great banks of leaden clouds sagging over the horizon had dulled the water to blackness , and a stiff gale was whistling inshore . Already the billows were mounting angrily into caps of snarling foam and dashing themselves on the sands with threatening echo . It promised to be a nasty night , and Jack remembered as he looked that he was on patrol duty . Yet although the muscles of his jaw tightened into grimness , it was not the prospective tramp along a lonely beach in the darkness and wind that caused the stern tensity of his countenance . Storms and their perils were all in the day 's work , and he faced their possible catastrophes without a tremor . It would have been hard to find anywhere along the Massachusetts coast a braver man than Jack Nickerson . Not only was he ready to lead a crew of rescuers to succor the perishing , fearlessly directing the surfboat in its plunge through a seething tide , but many a time he had dashed bodily into the breakers , despite the hazard of a powerful undertow , and dragged some drowning creature"	""""""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""" """""""" """""""" """""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""""""" """""""""" """""""""""""" """""""""""" """""""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""
a bunch of college boys , who took to that kind of thing with glee . Having got their blood up , they decided they might as well clean out the Red movement entirely , so they rushed a place called the “ International Book - Shop , ” kept by a Hawaiian . The proprietor dodged into the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant next door , and put on an apron ; but no one had ever seen a Chinaman with a black mustache , so they fell on him and broke several of the Chinaman 's sauce - pans over his head . They took the contents of the “ International Book - Shop ” into the back yard and started a bon - fire with it , and detectives and college boys on a lark joined hands and danced an imitation of the Hawaiian hula - hula around the blaze . So Peter lived a merry life for several months . He had one or two journeys for nothing , because an obstinate judge refused to admit that anything that any I. W. W. had ever said or done anywhere within the last ten years was proper testimony to be introduced against a particular I. W. W. on trial . But most judges were willing to co - operate with the big business men in ridding the country of the Red menace , and Peter 's total of scalps amounted to over a hundred before his time was up , and Guffey sent him his last cheek and turned him loose . That was in the city of Richport , and Peter having in an inside pocket something over a thousand dollars in savings , felt that he had earned a good time . He went for a stroll on the Gay White Way of the city , and in front of a moving picture palace a golden - haired girl smiled at him . This was still in the days of two and three - fourths per cent beer , and Peter invited her into a saloon to have a glass , and when he opened his eyes again it was dark , and he had a splitting headache , and he groped around and discovered that he was lying in a dark corner of an alleyway . Terror gripped his heart , and he clapped his hand to the inside pocket where his wallet had been , and there was nothing but horrible emptiness . So Peter was ruined once again , and as usual it was a woman that had done it ! Peter went to the police - station , but they never found the woman , or if they did , they divided with her and not with Peter . He threw himself on the mercy of the sergeant at the desk , and succeeded in convincing the sergeant that he , Peter , was a part of the machinery of his	W. W.

wheel and with Hal 's help got safely on to the straw where he lay quite still . “ Ready ? ” said French , and then turned the horses about without waiting for an answer , and drove out of the gate amidst the jests and farewells of the onlookers . “ You wo n't forget the flannel ? ” Sue called after him . French 's deep , pleasant voice rang back through the thin , cold air : “ Rather would I forget the wagon , mistress . ” Sue laughed . “ There 's a new gown on the way , ” she said with a sigh of satisfaction as she went back to the kitchen . Anny gulped and Hal , turning at that moment , saw her disappointed little face in the moonlight . She looked at him so sorrowfully without speaking , and then went into the Inn . He was about to follow her but checked himself ; he began to realize a little how much she cared for pretty things and what she had given up with the sail - cloth bundle . Pushing his hands into his pockets he walked out of the gate and down the road to the sea , his chin on his breast . He had not gone very far before he met old Gilbot stumping along alone . The old man hailed him cheerily and bade him go down to fetch little Red who , he averred , was scooning stones on the clear sea . “ No one obeys me , ” he concluded with a chuckle . “ I ca n't make the young one come . Go fetch him , Hal . ” He waddled off , smiling and talking to himself . Hal walked on in deep thought , kicking the stones in the road with his clogs . Anny was fond of pretty fripperies and ornaments ; she liked to be admired and looked at , and would have kept the sail - cloth bundle for its own worth , without a thought for the giver . Hal kicked at a stone savagely , and swore loudly . He was eighteen and as bitter against the world as it is possible to be at that age . He remembered Anny 's little white face in the moonlight as Big French drove off , Sue 's request in his ears , and her disappointed , sorrowful glance at him before she returned to the kitchen . He had reached the sea by this time and he stood for a moment peering out over the mist - ridden water . “ If only I had money , ” he thought . “ Lord ! ” Staring out into the white moonlit vapour he saw Anny in her honey - coloured silk , her eyes bright and her lips a little parted , just as he had seen her that afternoon . Then	, ” he said , “ n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , n't forget , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , ” he said , “ ” he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , a little he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , he sa little , a little he , a little he , a little he , a little he , a little he , a little he , he a little he , a little he , he a little he , a little he , he a little he , a little he , he a little he , a little he , he a little he , he a little he , he a little he , he a little he , a little he , he a little he , he a little he , he a little he he

For the last six months I 've found 'em useful for the same little game . You see , I send a pal , as it might be you , to call on the guy who wants to take my rooms . He comes under pretence of offering the new tenant a choice of wall - papers ; as a matter of fact , I simply use him to inspect the furniture that must guarantee the rent . As you may suppose , I never do pay for the papering . Not much ! The offer 's made — and there it ends ! ” Fandor showed no surprise . The business his strange employer was sending him on was of course perfectly straightforward and legitimate ! Still keeping to his slangy way of speaking , Fandor merely asked : “ And what 's the name , M'sieu Moche , your dicky - bird goes by ? and what 's her exact address in the Rue des Couronnes ? ” M. Moche , while talking to his clerk , was busy changing his down - at - heel slippers for a pair of elastic - sided boots , obviously too small for him , the whitey - brown cracks in which he masked by smearing them with ink . He was bending down behind his desk and could not see the other 's face as he answered his last question : “ The dicky - bird , as you call her , lives , to be exact , at 142 _ bis _ Rue des Couronnes .

had screamed and fainted ! Yes , they had cleaned them out . But that was n't all of it , they were going to finish the job tonight , by God ! They were going to give these pacifists a taste of the war , they were going to put an end to the Red Terror in American City ! Peter might go along if he liked and see the good work ; they were going into the country , and it would be dark , and if he kept a mask on he would be quite safe . And Peter said yes ; his blood was up , he was full of the spirit of the hunt , he wanted to be in at the death , regardless of everything . Section 59 The motor purred softly , and the car sped as if upon wings thru the suburbs of American City , and to the country beyond . There were cars in front , and other cars behind , a long stream of white lights flying out into the country . They came to a grove of big pine trees , which rose two or three feet thick , like church arches , and covered the ground beneath them with a soft , brown carpet . It was a well - known picnic place , and here all the cars were gathering by appointment . Evidently it had all been pre - arranged , with that efficiency which is the pride of 100 % Americans . A man with a black mask over his face stood in the center of the grove , and shouted his directions thru a megaphone , and each car as it swept in ranged itself alongside the next car in a broad circle , more than a hundred feet across . These cars of the younger members of the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants ' and Manufacturers ' Association were well behaved -- they were accustomed to sliding precisely into place according to orders of a megaphone man , when receptions were being given , or when the younger members and their wives and fiancees , clad in soft silks and satins , came rolling up to their dinner - parties and dances . The cars came and came , until there was just room enough for the last one to slide in . Then at a shouted command , “ Number one ! ” a group of men stepped out of one of the cars , dragging a handcuffed prisoner . It was Michael Dubin , the young Jewish tailor who had spent fifteen days in jail with Peter . Michael was a student and dreamer , and not used to scenes of violence ; also , he belonged to a race which expresses its emotions , and consequently is offensive to 100 % Americans . He screamed and moaned while the masked men un - handcuffed him , and	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Without appearing to pay any heed to the astonishment he provoked , the man went on : “ You must know that these _ trains de luxe _ , such as the one we are in , are often worked by pickpockets , and that these gentry find a malicious satisfaction in robbing passengers even of articles of little value , simply with the object of keeping their hand in . ” Van Buren did not know what to say , Mrs. Bigelow smiled nervously , while not without a touch of anxiety , the Princess Sonia Danidoff , whose lips were trembling a little , murmured with a forced laugh : “ Pooh ! we ought not to be afraid , surely , seeing the renowned Tom Bob is with us ... but is he really with us ? ” “ Why , yes ! ” cried Hamilton Gould . “ I 'm ready to wager he is . ” “ Will you show us the man ? ” demanded Mrs. Bigelow . “ Perhaps I may , who knows ? ” Then all burst out laughing ; Ascott had just drawn their attention to the smoking compartment at the far end of the car , where a passenger lay fast asleep , adding the suggestion : “ Perhaps it 's that gentleman . ” First the men , then the ladies , all equally amused and curious , stole one by one to peep in at the traveller who was still fast asleep , little dreaming of the interest he aroused . But the man of the silvery hair again drew attention to himself by his criticism of Ascott 's identification . “ It shows a want of perspicacity , sir , ” he declared , “ to take the gentleman sleeping there for Tom Bob . In the first place a detective does not sleep ; besides which , one has only to look at your man in the smoking carriage to be quite sure , first , that he is a Frenchman ; that is plain from the cut of his clothes , and second , that he is an officer , in fact I should say an officer actually serving with the colours . ” Much impressed , Sonia Danidoff drew nearer to the speaker : “ And what tells you that , sir ? ” The man bowed gravely . “ Nothing simpler , madam !

Later , when it was all over , they went down to the street floor at Ralph 's suggestion , where they put on their Tele - motor - coasters , preparatory to seeing more of New York -- this time by night . The party proceeded to roll down Broadway , the historic thoroughfare of New York . Despite the fact that it was 11 o'clock at night , the streets were almost as light as at noonday . They were illuminated brilliantly by the iridium spirals , hanging high above the crossings . These spirals gave forth a pure , dazzling - white light of the same quality as sunlight . This light moreover was absolutely cold , as all electrical energy was transformed into light , none being lost in heat . Not a street was dark -- not even the smallest alley . James 212B 422 , as well as his daughter , lingered over the superb displays in the various stores and they entered several to make a few purchases . Alice was much impressed with the automatic - electric packing machines . The clerk making the sale placed the purchased articles on a metal platform . He then pushed several buttons on a small switchboard , which operated the """""""" size """""""" apparatus to obtain the dimensions of the package . After the last button was pressed , the platform rose about two feet , till it disappeared into a large metal , box - like contrivance .

The box was not fastened with any strings or tape , but was folded in an ingenious manner so that it could not open of its own accord . Moreover , it was made of _ Alohydrolium _ , which is the lightest of all metals , being one - eighth the weight of aluminum . The automatic packing machine could pack anything from a small package a few inches square up to a box two feet high by three feet long .

"Davey , """""""" she said . """""""" I want to finish turning this heel . """""""" CHAPTER XIII The summer of Davey 's first year 's work with his father was the driest the early settlers had known in the South . A breathless , insistent heat brooded over the hills , their narrow valleys and the long , bare Wirree plains . The grass stood stiff and straw - like by the roads and in the cleared paddocks , rustling when anything moved in it . Hordes of straw - coloured grasshoppers lay in it , whistling and whispering huskily , or rose with whirring wings when anything disturbed them . The skies , faded to grey , gave no promise of rain , and when the sun set it left a dull , angry flush -- the colour of a black snake 's belly -- behind the hills . The lesser mountain streams dried up . The creek that ran through Cameron 's paddocks became a mere trickle . There was only one deep pool left of it . In that only enough water remained to keep the household going for a month , when Donald Cameron mustered , and he , Davey , and the stockmen drove the cattle to the Clearwater River , ten miles away to the south - west . It was still in good condition and Cameron held three hundred acres of the river frontage there . He was better off than most of the hill folk who , after driving their cattle a dozen miles or so for water , had to pay high prices for paddocks to run them in . Every man of Cameron 's was away at the Clearwater , and Mrs. Cameron and Jenny alone at the homestead , the afternoon that Deirdre came riding up out of the misty depths of the trees . For days a heavy , yellowish - grey haze had covered the hills . Mrs. Cameron could not from her doorway see the slopes of the ranges behind the house . The mist hung like a pall over the trees , seeming to stifle the wild life of them . Not a twitter of birds was heard . Parroquets , breaking the dun - coloured mist with the scarlet and blue and green of their wings and breasts , dashed over the clearing , chattering hoarsely . Now and then they rose from the orchard with shrill screams , as Jenny drove them away from the few shrivelled plums left on the trees by flapping a dish - cloth at them . The air was full of the smell of burning .

already Fandor was regaining his composure . That Elisabeth , terribly upset by last night 's violence , in which she believed him to have been concerned , took him for Fantômas , was after all of small importance . He could easily convince her of the truth . What was more serious was the monstrous folly he had committed in bolting away in that unceremonious fashion from Mme . Doulenques a moment before . Now on the stairs a prodigious uproar was swelling louder and louder , while the shrill voice of the concierge rose high above the clamour : “ A scoundrelly brigand , I tell you ! one of the same lot for sure who attacked the girl yesterday ! ” People were thronging upstairs , heavy footsteps sounded on the boards , a crowd of neighbours was hurrying up to the scene of action . Instinctively Fandor stepped back on the landing . For nearly six months he had been living the life of a fugitive ; for all those months the unfortunate young man had known the gnawing anxieties of a never - ending flight from all whose interest it might be to discover his identity . Now , finding himself pursued , trapped on this stairway , he lost his head . Instead of quietly waiting till the concierge and her satellites came up to him and then explaining the misunderstanding , Fandor , realizing that Elisabeth would be long in recognizing her mistake , resolved to fly . Swiftly , noiselessly , nimbly , he mounted to the seventh story of the house , in the vague hope of finding a hiding - place . Fortune favoured him . The house was an enormous block of workmen 's dwellings , made up of several separate buildings , connected together and served by several different staircases . Fandor , following the corridor running between the rooms on the topmost floor , had the luck to come upon the landing of a second flight of stairs . To make up his mind , to dart to the top , to scamper down the stairway , never stopping to know what had become of his pursuers , to dash into the street and reach the line of the outer boulevards at a run , was the work of a moment . Bathed in sweat and panting for breath , he reached the Boulevard de Belleville — and knew he was safe . Safe , yes , but alas ! atrociously disappointed . An hour ago he was on his way , in joyful anticipation , to visit Elisabeth Dollon , blessing the happy chance that was to bring him to the girl 's presence ; now he had but caught a glimpse of her , had not so much as spoken with her ; all he knew was that she believed him guilty of the most dreadful crimes , that she coupled his name with a	Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor Fandor , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Fandor Fandor Fandor Fandor , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Elisabeth Fandor , Fandor , Fandor , Fandor , Fandor , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Fandor Fandor Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Fandor Fandor , Fandor , Elisabeth Dollon , Fandor Fandor , Fandor , Fandor , Fandor , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon , Elisabeth Dollon
be a juicy morsel to be gobbled up by some fellow with a normal appetite ? She was alone in the house all day with Peter , and she got to seem more and more pretty as he got to know her better . Also it was evident that she liked Peter more and more as Peter played his game . Peter revealed himself as deeply sympathetic , and a quick convert to the cause ; he saw everything that Jennie explained to him , he was horrified at the horrible stories , he was ready to help her end the European war by starting a revolution among the working people of American City . Also , he told her about himself , and awakened her sympathy for his harsh life , his twenty years of privation and servitude ; and when she wept over this , Peter liked it . It was fine , somehow , to have her so sorry for him ; it helped to compensate him for the boredom of hearing her be sorry for the whole working class . Peter did n't know whether Jennie had learned about his bad record , but he took no chances -- he told her everything , and thus took the sting out of it . Yes , he had been trapped into evil ways , but it was n't his fault , he had n't known any better , he had been a pitiful victim of circumstances . He told how he had been starved and driven about and beaten by “ Old Man ” Drubb , and the tears glistened in Jennie 's grey eyes and stole down her cheeks . He told about loneliness and heartsickness and misery in the orphan asylum . And how could he , poor lad , realize that it was wrong to help Pericles Priam sell his Peerless Pain Paralyzer ? How could he know whether the medicine was any good or not -- he did n't even know now , as a matter of fact . As for the Temple of Jimjambo , all that Peter had done was to wash dishes and work as a kitchen slave , as in any hotel or restaurant . It was a story easy to fix up , and especially easy because the first article in the creed of Socialist Jennie was that economic circumstances were to blame for human frailties . That opened the door for all varieties of grafters , and made the child such an easy mark that Peter would have been ashamed to make a victim of her , had it not been that she happened to stand in the path of his higher purposes -- and also that she happened to be young , only seventeen , with tender grey eyes , and tempting , sweet lips , alone there in the house all day .

, that Alice could be brought back to life , had been snatched out of his hands . Without the Permagatol , it was impossible to save her . There was nothing to keep the beautiful dead body from disintegrating . While the Radium - K Bromide stayed the process to a certain extent , the respiratory organs could only be saved by means of the precious Permagatol . Could he use a substitute gas ? It was a dangerous experiment to make , but he had nothing to lose , and everything to gain . He threw himself with a frenzy into the work and in six hours had compounded a gas that , in its general structure and atomic weight , came close to the properties and characteristics of Permagatol . The gas he evolved was Armagatol , and while he knew that it had never been used for the purpose for which he intended it , he felt justified in risking the experiment . After the air had been drawn from the glass case , he immediately introduced the Armagatol into it . The change in Alice 's face shocked him , as he watched the Armagatol fill the case . The green gas - vapors cast an unearthly green pallor over her countenance , and the ghastliness was further enhanced by the deathly pallor of her face . He arranged the electric heating pads around Alice 's body , and inspected the registering instruments . It had now become necessary to take his bearings . He found to his amazement that instead of being close to Mars , as he had expected , he was moving away from that body . The two space flyers , although their machinery was not working , had been moving rapidly , due to the gravitational action of the nearest large celestial body . This body was not Mars , however , but Earth . Although , at the time of the encounter with Llysanorh ' , the two machines had been slightly nearer to Mars , the larger mass , and consequently the stronger attraction of the Earth had overcome the pull that Mars exerted on the machines , and as a result the machines were now being drawn toward Earth . A glance at the celestial chart revealed to Ralph that Earth and Mars would be in opposition the next day and that he was separated from Earth by twenty - two million miles . He would have to move faster than Earth if he were to overtake that body . Besides , he was twenty - two million miles to the east of the planet . The Earth was traveling 65,533 miles per hour in its orbit . A simple calculation indicated that , by forcing his space flyer to the utmost , or 90,000 miles an hour , he could not hope to reach Earth in less than fifty days , as he could only gain	Permagatol snatched Alice 's face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her face , snatched her .
months since we last went foul them coastguards and since then we 've been coming and going as though the damned old Channel belonged to us . Such scatter - brained tricks do n't pay in the end . ” “ You be careful what you 're saying , Mat Turnby , ” piped a shivering , miserable , little man , who was trying to protect himself from the cutting February wind with a ragged , parti - coloured blanket which he continually wrapped and unwrapped about his skeleton - like shoulders , “ you be careful what you 're saying . All kinds o ' things on this ship have ears , ” and he nodded once or twice significantly . The big man moved uneasily on his unstable seat , but he answered boldly enough : “ I saying ? Here , you mind what you 're saying , you snivelling rat ! Saying ? I 'm not saying aught as I am ashamed of -- I say these daring tricks do n't pay in the end -- and -- and -- they do n't , ” he finished abruptly . “ Oh ! it 's not for the likes o ' us to talk about what the Captain does , ” said the little man whiningly . He snuffled noisily and unwrapped and wrapped his blanket again . “ Not for the likes o ' us , ” he repeated . “ Who 's saying aught of the Cap'n ? ” roared Mat , bringing the cask to the deck with a thud . “ Who 's saying aught of the Cap'n ? ” “ Oh ! no one , no one at all , ” said the shiverer , considerably startled . Then he added , as the big man slid back against the mast once more : “ But if no one did -- that 's all right , ai n't it ? If no one did , I say . ” Mat swore a round of obscene oaths under his breath and there was silence for a minute or two . They were nearly at the end of the trip . Indeed , another two hours or so would see them safely at anchor in the safest of all smugglers ' havens -- the mouth of the River Blackwater , and their cargo easily and openly landed on Mersea Marsh Island . The shivering little man smiled to himself at the thought of it . The warm kitchen at the Victory Inn , the smoking rum - cup , and the pleasant sallies of the fair Eliza appealed to his present mood , and he sniffled again and rearranged his blanket . The green , white - splashed water lapped against the boat and a big saddle - backed gull flew over , screaming plaintively . Mat began to talk again . “ I wonder why we do it , ” he said	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Shanghai ? ” “ I wish it was , ” said Gaylord Ravenal . Somewhat dazedly he walked down the _ Lady Lee 's _ gangplank and retorted testily to a beady - eyed giant - footed gentleman who immediately spoke to him in a low and not unfriendly tone , “ Give me time , ca n't you ! I have n't been twenty - four hours stepping from the gangplank to this wharf , have I ? Well , then ! ” “ No offence , Gay , ” said the gentleman , his eyes still searching the other passengers as they filed across the narrow gangplank . “ Just thought I 'd remind you , case of trouble . You know how Vallon is . ” Vallon had said , briefly , later , “ That 's all right , Gay . But by this time to - morrow evening — — ” He had eyed Ravenal 's raiment with a comprehending eye . “ Cigar ? ” The weed he proffered was slim , pale , and frayed as the man who stood before him . Gaylord Ravenal 's jangling nerves ached for the solace of tobacco ; but he viewed this palpably second - hand gift with a glance of disdain that was a triumph of the spirit over the flesh . Certainly no man handicapped by his present sartorial and social deficiencies was justified in raising a quizzical right eyebrow in the manner employed by Ravenal . “ What did you call it ? ” said he now . Vallon looked at it . He was not a quick - witted gentleman . “ Cigar . ” “ Optimist . ” And strolled out of the chiefs office , swinging the little malacca cane . So then , you now saw him leaning moodily against a wooden case on the New Orleans plank wharf , distinguished , shabby , dapper , handsome , broke , and twenty - four . It was with some amusement that he had watched the crew of the _ Mollie Able _ bring the flat unwieldy bulk of the _ Cotton Blossom _ into the wharfside in the midst of the confusion of packets , barges , steamboats , tugs , flats , tramp boats , shanty boats . He had spoken briefly and casually to Schultzy while that bearer of evil tidings , letter in hand , waited impatiently on the dock as the _ Cotton Blossom _ was shifted to a landing position farther upstream . He had seen these floating theatres of the Mississippi and the Ohio many times , but he had never before engaged one of their actors in conversation . “ Juvenile lead ! ” he had exclaimed , unable to hide something of incredulity in his voice .

understand one another from the beginning ... So please sign your name there , mademoiselle”—and with his great hairy finger , M. Moche pointed out the place . This formality completed , she bade a hasty farewell to M. Moche , who escorted her politely to the door . * * * * * “ Brigand , scoundrel , blackguard , thief!”—a torrent of insults , followed by a torrent of blows ... M. Moche was on the point of recrossing his threshold when he was struck full in the face and felled to the ground . As he lay there , he felt the weight of a man 's body crushing him , holding him forcibly down . But Moche , for all his years , was a wonderfully active man , and quite unexpectedly nimble . In one second he had shaken off the incubus and leapt to the other end of the room , where he stood glaring at his assailant . It was Paulet he saw , but Paulet changed beyond recognition — eyes starting out of his head , mouth set hard , features convulsed , muscles taut . The lover of Nini Guinon , knife in hand , was for hurling himself at M. Moche , when suddenly he stopped dead . The sharp click of a cocked pistol had struck him motionless where he stood . Moche , quick as lightning , had not only dodged the villain 's furious onslaught , but had whipped a revolver from his pocket and pointed the weapon straight at the scoundrel 's breast — “ Not another step , ” he vociferated , “ or I shoot you like a dog ! ” At the same moment a cry of anguish rang out . Behind Paulet appeared the face of Nini Guinon , pale and agonized ; her two hands clutched her lover , whom she was holding back with all her strength . But the man had realized the risk involved in a fresh attack , and was ready to parley . The voice shook that came from between his clenched teeth : “ Brigand ! ” he repeated , looking furiously at Moche , “ brigand , give me back my money ! ” For a moment the old advocate entertained the idea of shamming ignorance , pretending not to know what the murderer meant by the demand . But a half - dozen words that fell from Nini 's lips decided him . “ I saw you fumbling in the money - bag , ” she declared , and he knew at once that dissimulation was useless . The wisest policy was to take the bull by the horns there and then — and he had his plan all ready , cut and dried . Best to play the game cards face upwards on the table . “ No , ” he declared , grimly , “ I will not give you back	Moche shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his face , he , he , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he , he was , he was , he , he was , he , he was , he , he was , he , he , he was , he , he was , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he ,

Until the trinket came back from Boston , therefore , he must bide his time with patience . Nevertheless the logic of these arguments did not prevent him from turning sharply toward the door of the workshop whenever there was a footfall on the grass . Any day , any hour , any moment the lady of his dreams might appear once more . Had not Willie said that she sometimes trimmed bonnets for Tiny ? And was it not possible , yea , even likely that his aunt might be needing a bonnet right away . Women were always needing bonnets , argued the young man vaguely ; at least , both his mother and sister were , and he had not yet lived long enough in his aunt 's household to realize that with Tiny Morton the purchase of a bonnet was not an equally casual enterprise . He even had the temerity to ask Celestina when he saw her arrayed for the grange one afternoon why she did not have a hat with pink in it and was chagrined to receive the reply that she did not like pink ; and that anyway her hat was well enough as it was , and she should n't have another for a good couple of years .

and Peter suddenly realized that his ultimate desire in life was to possess a “ swell lady - friend ” like Nell . He realized that there was one essential prerequisite , and that was money . None of them would look at you without money . Nell had gone out with him only once , and that was upon the savings of six months , and Peter had not been able to conceal the effort it cost him to spend it all . So he had been set down as a “ tight - wad , ” and had made no headway . Nell had disappeared , along with everybody else when the police raided the Temple . Peter never knew what had become of her , but the old longings still haunted him , and he would find himself imagining -- suppose the police had got her ; suppose she were in jail , and he with his new “ pull ” were able to get her out , and carry her away and keep her hid from the laundry man ! These were dreams ; but meantime here was reality , here was a new world . Peter had settled down in the home of the Todd sisters ; and what was their attitude toward these awful mysteries of love ? Section 17 It had been arranged with Guffey that at the end of a week Peter was to have a secret meeting with one of the chief detective 's men . So Peter told the girls that he was tired of being a prisoner in the house and must get some fresh air . “ Oh please , Mr. Gudge , do n't take such a chance ! ” cried Sadie , her thin , anxious face suddenly growing more anxious and thin . “ Do n't you know this house is being watched ? They are just hoping to catch you out alone . It would be the last of you . ” “ I 'm not so important as that , ” said Peter ; but she insisted that he was , and Peter was pleased , in spite of his boredom , he liked to hear her insist upon his importance . “ Oh ! ” she cried . “ Do n't you know yet how much depends on you as a witness for the Goober defense ? This case is of concern to millions of people all over the world ! It is a test case , Mr. Gudge -- are they to be allowed to murder the leaders of the working class without a struggle ? No , we must show them that there is a great movement , a world - wide awakening of the workers , a struggle for freedom for the wage slaves-- ” But Peter could stand no more of this . “ All right , ” he said , suddenly interrupting Sadie 's eloquence . “	, ” he cried , “ oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh n't , ” he , “ ” he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he
these mountains . Hither , Anselmo . Listen , you , all of you , that you may die with laughter at what Anselmo tells . ” There was a pause while Anselmo came to the group : there were greetings of “ How so ? ” ; then the first speaker spoke again . “ Anselmo , ” he said , “ these have not heard of your meeting with the gringo upon these mountains . Tell them , then . ” “ Ah , ” Anselmo answered in the voice of him who had shot at Sard the day before . “ It is thus ; if you will see . I was in the mountains , in the pine - barren , where lately a justice of the people was achieved . I , sauntering there , considering many things , since it is my nature to consider , beheld suddenly a gringo , beastly even beyond the nature of such . For a moment I thought , ‘ Lo , now , a prospector . ' Then I saw from certain signs that he was neither this nor that , but an Americano , a Tejano , an Inglés , what matter ? This one ( I also saw ) was lost , as such always are if ever they leave a marked road . “ ‘ Good day , sir , ' I said ; since it is ever my custom to be courteous . What , we are not brutes nor Luteranos , I hope ; we can be civil one to other . Civility , as they say , costs nothing , yet makes many debtors . I , therefore , did not spit at him as one without faith . ‘ Good day , sir , ' I said , ‘ I trust that you are well , that your señora is well , that your honoured parents preserve their health , even at their great age . ' “ He rolled his eyes upon me like a cow dying of thirst . The gringos have the eyes of cows rather than of men . ‘ Tell me , ' he said to me , ‘ the way out of these mountains . ' “ ‘ Truly , sir , ' I said , ‘ you who bring civilisation to our savageries will not so soon leave us . Stay , I entreat you , to dine , or at least to sup , or to sing thus to the piano as do the women of you gringos . Yet , since you must leave us , continue , ' I said , ‘ a day 's journey north - eastward , till you reach a place where all the rocks are rotten . There you will find a path over the mountains , good for men , excellent for beasts , having grass , inns , a road , good air	Anselmo saunterte , saunterte , saunterte , saunterte , saunterte , saunterte , saunterte , saunterte , saunterte , sauntering , sauntering , sauntering , sauntering , sauntering , sup .
“ walk him down ” to the edge of the jetty . Ill as Sard was , the men , their voices and their every action , made him feel that his life hung upon a thread . He knew , too late , that he had come upon a gang of rum - runners in the act of putting their freight ashore . There was no question of showing fight ; he could only hope that they would not shoot him in the back and leave him to the crabs . He was walked to the hard - wood blinders at the very edge of the jetty . He saw beneath him a broadish stretch of water reaching to the high land beyond . The river bar was noisy at some little distance to his left . Just below him was a scow - launch half full of cases . She was lifting and drooping a little to the motion of the water . A deck hand , sitting on her forward gunwale , was staring up at him . A short , foreign - looking man , with a bush of hair under which gold earrings shone , came out from the covered engine - room abaft - all , and stood there , in a glow of light , holding on by the wheel . He , too , stared up at Sard , but went on eating an onion : he did not speak . His eyes were intensely bright : his shirt , which was whitish , with a few coloured stripes , seemed to shine as though it were made of silk . Sard took all these things in very exactly in an instant of time , but noticed most the man with the bright eyes who munched the onion and stared . The deck hand who was sitting forward pitched a folded tarpaulin over some cases directly below Sard . He did it on the instant , with a backward jerk of his hand . Sard knew on the instant what had passed through the man 's mind ; that it would be a pity if his , Sard 's , corpse should break any of the good rum bottles in falling . The man in authority called out behind Sard . “ If there are any more of you , who try to lift a finger , over your friend goes . ” Sard kept very still ; everybody was very still , except for the launchman munching his onion and the clicking back of revolver cocks . The man in authority called out again : “ Go through him , you two . ” The two men “ went through ” Sard 's pockets , not like thieves , but like policemen . “ Is he heeled ? ” “ No , sir ; he 's got a knife . He 's been in the water . ” “ He 'll	Sard sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he 
Sard had laid him . His feet stuck up out of the earth , one bare and one slippered foot . Sard did not think of him , but of the bits of tamale that had been scattered there the day before . To his intense joy they were there still ; altogether there were enough bits of tamale and bean pulp to outweigh a ship 's biscuit . Hungry as he was , he determined to save half of his find for the next day . He thought , “ I depend on a bandit 's hanging for to - day 's food : to - morrow I need not expect to be so lucky : ‘ it is not always May ' : still , ‘ God will provide . ' ” He followed the tracks of the bandits till he heard a wolf howling , with a dog answering him howl for howl . Presently , as he went on , he heard horses squealing at each other : he smelt horses . Next he heard a man singing in a shrill falsetto , with many shakes , to the twangle of a guitar . Following the noise in the moonlight , he came to a flat pan or gully through which a brook , that had made the gully , still passed on its way to the sea . The hills came closely about the pan , giving it shelter from all gales : this ( with the water supply ) had made it desirable to the Indians in old time . The Indians had long since gone from it . It was now peopled by the outlaws who had done the hanging in the pine - barren : their tracks led into it ; their voices sounded from the midst of it . Sard made out a line of huts stretching irregularly across the pan on the line of a track or trail . The falsetto singer was in the midst of the pan , dancing as he sang . Men were sitting about at the doors of their huts , talking , or at least uttering remarks . “ Such , indeed , is life . ” “ Between Sunday and Monday there is ever midnight . ” “ She , being a woman , is , as one may say , a woman . ” “ The gringos , the accursed : is there anything more accursed ? ” “ Good wine , good water and good sausage : truly three good things . ” Sard heard these things uttered with all the dignity of a Solomon pronouncing judgments . Dogs were nosing about among the huts , picking bits of tamale . Sard felt that it would be wiser to move boldly down to the village than to stay skulking in the brush till a dog nosed him . He walked boldly down into the gully and passed at the back of	Sard , er dachte , er müßte es tun , er müßte es tun , er müßte es tun , er müßte es tun , er müßte es tun .
the vilest crimes , but whom _ she _ well knew to be innocent ! Jérôme Fandor , how that name evoked at once fear and pity in the breast of that beautiful and mysterious personage , the Grand Duchess Alexandra . What memories did it not call up of the saddest tragedies of her life ? Jérôme Fandor , perhaps the only living being who could possibly share with Juve the knowledge that she , the Grand Duchess Alexandra , was in reality named Lady Beltham , was in reality the mistress of Fantômas ! And now it was this same Jérôme Fandor , to - day her lover 's implacable foe , to - morrow no doubt his accuser , who came asking the favour of an interview ! who asked the boon in the name of love ! Lady Beltham stood trembling , her breath coming quick and fast as she read and re - read the brief note just passed to her . Then suddenly , shaking off all doubts , she made her decision . Yes , seeing it was in the name of love that Jérôme Fandor wrote , seeing he besought her pity , she would not refuse his prayer . “ My life , my unhappy life , ” thought Lady Beltham , “ has but one excuse — love . Whensoever I hear that name invoked , I shall be found ready to recognize the only sentiment I feel some little respect for ! ” But a bewildering , a terrible problem still confronted the great lady ; with what surprise , with what agitation she realized that Fandor was in her house , and must be there , the very terms of his letter showed it , disguised as Fantômas — in the same disguise as Tom Bob ? There were two “ Fantômas ” then among the dancers , the American detective and Jérôme Fandor . It was quite possible , quite probable indeed , as she soon came to see . The costumes the detective and the journalist had donned must obviously be alike , if they were correct : was it not therefore allowable to suppose there were two “ Fantômas ” in the rooms without anyone having so far noted the fact : naturally people would conclude it was the same masquer they saw each time . Why , she herself was deceived just now , believing herself in the presence of Fantômas - Tom Bob , when she was actually standing before Fantômas - Fandor ! Eventually Lady Beltham returned to the dancing rooms , thinking to herself : “ I will go presently into the conservatory ; he is sure to be watching me and will join me there . ” * * * * * While the grand duchess in the retirement of her private apartments was reading the strange note slipped into her hand by Fandor , who had likewise come ,	Jérôme Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fandor Fandor Fandor , Fandor , Fandor , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas , Fantômas ,
the wind and her ragged garments flying like streamers out behind her . The bitter memory of her last encounter with Pet Salt still rankled with her , and the thought of Anny 's enforced marriage to the Spaniard made her hate the other old woman more deeply than before . She had sworn to Anny that she would prevent her sailing with Dick , and it was to fulfil this promise that she was striding through the night . To prevent Dick from carrying off Anny ! Nan had thought over her self - allotted task very carefully , and to her there seemed but one way to accomplish it . She had decided to take that way . And as she hastened on , her thin brown fingers gripped her long staff fiercely and from time to time she stopped to feel the heavy round stone which was bound to the top of it , making a once - harmless walking - stick a formidable weapon . On she went , her head held high , and her sharp eyes fixed ahead as if she were seeking to pierce the blackness which closed in all around her . “ They do not sail till eleven , ” she muttered , “ and she would not go at once . I shall be in time to catch them as they come out of the yard . Ay , that is it , as they come out of the yard ; it is dark there , ” and , mumbling to herself , she clambered through a gap in the hedge and stumbled out into the Ship lane . She had now a very little way to go , and her grip on her staff tightened as she hurried on . A sharp bend in the road brought her in sight of the Ship . She could see the lights from the kitchen gleaming through the trees . She pressed on for a few more yards and then stopped suddenly and , holding her breath , stood rigid for a second , listening . There was silence everywhere and the old woman shifted uneasily . “ No noise ? ” she muttered . “ No noise ? What has come to the Ship on sailing night that all should be so still ? ” Keeping her eyes fixed on the lighted window , she hastened on to the yard gates . There she paused again . The Ship was silent as before , and then , as she stood there watching , the door opened and a slim figure stood silhouetted against the bright background for a second and then staggered out toward her . Without further thought Nan strode forward , her staff upraised . Hardly had she moved , however , when Hal 's terrible scream rang out through the open doorway . The old woman sprang forward , a faint inkling of what had happened flashing through	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
, ” be said . “ You got the dicks ? ” asked Peter . “ A dozen of them . What 's your idea now ? ” Peter stammered out his suggestions . There was a little grocery store just across the street from the entrance to the studio building . Peter would go in there , and pretend to get something to eat , and would watch thru the window , and the moment he saw the right men come in , he would hurry out and signal to McGivney , who would be in a drugstore at the next corner . McGivney must keep out of sight himself , because the “ Reds ” knew him as one of Guffey 's agents . It was n't necessary to repeat anything twice . McGivney was keyed up and ready for business , and Peter hurried down the street , and stepped into the little grocery store without being observed by anyone . He ordered some crackers and cheese , and seated himself on a box by the window and pretended to eat . But his hands were trembling so that he could hardly get the food into his mouth ; and this was just as well , because his mouth was dry with fright , and crackers and cheese are articles of diet not adapted to such a condition . He kept his eyes glued on the dingy doorway of the old studio building , and presently -- hurrah!--he saw McCormick coming down the street ! The Irish boy turned into the building , and a couple of minutes later came Gus the sailor , and before another five minutes had passed here came Joe Angell and Henderson . They were walking quickly , absorbed in conversation , and Peter could imagine he heard them talking about those mysterious notes , and who could be the writer , and what the devil could they mean ? Peter was now wild with nervousness ; he was afraid somebody in the grocery store would notice him , and he made desperate efforts to eat the crackers and cheese , and scattered the crumbs all over himself and over the floor . Should he wait for Jerry Rudd , or should he take those he had already ? He had got up and started for the door , when he saw the last of his victims coming down the street . Jerry was walking slowly , and Peter could n't wait until he got inside . A car was passing , and Peter took the chance to slip out and bolt for the drug store . Before he had got half way there McGivney had seen him , and was on the run to the next corner . Peter waited only long enough to see a couple of automobiles come whirling down the street , packed solid with husky detectives . Then he turned off and hurried down a side street	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the captain said . “ You are arrested . Your case will have every consideration . Meanwhile , to the barracks . ” “ To the barracks : march , ” the lieutenant added . If he had resisted , perhaps if he had said another word , they would have shot him and pitched him down a disused working . Sard knew that the silver escorts were apt to shoot to save trouble . He judged it best to submit . “ They are cross from the sandstorm , ” he thought ; “ soon they will have lunched ; then they will listen to reason ; or I can get word to some Englishman , or to the Consul . ” Like all sailors , he had the utmost contempt for soldiers ; to be jailed by soldiers was a bitter experience . The guards fell in on each side of him ; two men came behind him with fixed bayonets ; the officers brought up the rear with drawn revolvers ; the captain called “ March ! ” As they set out , the Occidental train - hand darted two steps forward and crouched to screech some insults . He mocked , showed his teeth and jeered at Sard , making again the gesture of the stomach - ripper . “ You get him , ” he screeched in English , “ you get - a your bag cut . A te te . . . ucho ! ” Just a couple of paces beyond this screamer , the other train - hand stood , twirling his club as though puzzled . He was looking hard at Sard with a face made of broken commandments : Sard expected a bat on the head from him as he passed . He did not get it : the man dropped his eyes as before , and spat sideways as though dismissing the thought of Sard . They passed out of the station enclosure to the town , which was crowded with inhabitants , who had either come to see the train or were now coming to see “ the bandit . ” Most of the citizens were mestizos or Indios . Sard looked in vain for an American or English face . He heard the comments passed upon him . “ An English bandit who robbed the silver train . ” “ That a white so sickly should have so much blood ! ” “ Ha , dirty thief , to the gallows ! ” “ Ho , Englishman , it is not so easy to rob our silver : we are not your Africans from whom you may rob gold . ” “ Englishman , the garota : cluck - cluck ! ” “ They say he killed seven before being taken . ” “ He ? An Englishman ? They were asleep , covered in their blankets . He stabbed them sleeping . ” “ Hear you	” he said , “ te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te te , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ ” he , “ te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te te ” he said , “ te te te te ” he said , “ te te te ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te te , ” he said , “ te te , ” he said , “ te te
wind whipped the billows into foam and a breath of storm brooded in the air , the Galbraiths ' great touring car rolled up to Willie 's cottage , and from it stepped not only Robert Morton 's old college chum , Roger Galbraith , but also his father , a finely built , middle - aged man whose decisive manner and quick speech characterized the leader and dictator . He was smooth - shaven after the English fashion and from beneath shaggy iron - gray brows a pair of dark eyes , piercing in their intensity , looked out . The face was lined as if the stress of living had drawn its muscles into habitual tensity , and except when a smile relieved the setness of the mouth his countenance was stern to severity . His son , on the other hand , possessed none of his father 's force of personality . Although his features were almost a replica of those of the older man , they lacked strength ; it was as if the second impression taken from the type had been less clear - cut and positive . The eyes were clear rather than penetrating , the mouth and chin handsome but mobile ; even the well - rounded physique lacked the rugged qualities that proclaimed its development to have been the result of a Spartan combat with the world and instead bore the more artificial sturdiness acquired from sports and athletics . Nevertheless Roger Galbraith , if not the warrior his progenitor had been , presented no unmanly appearance . Neither self - indulgence nor effeminacy branded him . In fact , there was in his manner a certain magnetism and warmth of sympathy that the elder man could not boast , and it was because of this asset he had never wanted for friends and probably never would want for them . Through the talisman of charm he would exact from others the service which the more autocratic nature commanded . Yet in spite of the opposition of their personalities , Robert Morton cherished toward both father and son a sincere affection which differed only in the quality of the response the two men called forth . Mr. Galbraith he admired and revered ; Roger he loved . Had he but known it , each of the Galbraiths in their turn esteemed Robert Morton for widely contrasting reasons . The New York financier found in him a youth after his own heart,--a fine student and hard worker , who had fought his way to an education because necessity confronted him with the choice of going armed or unarmed into life 's fray . Although comfortably off , Mr. Morton senior was a man of limited income whose children had been forced to battle for what they had wrested from fortune . Success had not come easily to any of them , and the winning of it had left in its wake a self	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
in due and regular form . It would never do to have the mob suspect that these activities were being financed and directed by the big business interests of the city . But all the same , it made Peter sore ! He and McGivney and the rest of Guffey 's men had a contempt for the public officials , whom they regarded as “ pikers ” ; the officials had very little money to spend , and very little power . If you really wanted to get anything done in America , you did n't go to any public official , you went to the big men of affairs , the ones who had the “ stuff , ” and were used to doing things quickly and efficiently . It was the same in this business of spying as in everything else . Now and then Peter would realize how close he had come to ghastly ruin . He would have qualms of terror , picturing himself shut up in the hole , and Guffey proceeding to torture the truth out of him . But he was able to calm these fears . He was sure this dynamite conspiracy would prove too big a temptation for the authorities ; it would sweep them away in spite of themselves . They would have to go thru with it , they would have to stand by Peter . And sure enough , on the evening of the second day a jailer came and said : “ You 're to be let out . ” And Peter was ushered thru the barred doors and turned loose without another word . Section 49 Peter went to Room 427 of the American House and there was McGivney waiting for him . McGivney said nothing about any suspicion of Peter , nor did Peter say anything -- he understood that by - gones were to be by - gones . The authorities were going to take this gift which the fates had handed to them on a silver platter . For years they had been wanting to get these Reds , and now magically and incredibly , they had got them ! “ Now , Gudge , ” said McGivney , “ here 's your story . You 've been arrested on suspicion , you 've been cross - questioned and put thru the third degree , but you succeeded in satisfying the police that you did n't know anything about it , and they 've released you .

"; and when death had removed in succession all three of these props , leaving the little old man at last face to face with life , his startled blue eyes had grown large with terror . What was to become of him now ? Not only did Willie himself helplessly raise the interrogation but so did all Wilton . Of course he could go and board with the Eldridges but that would mean renting or selling the silver - gray cottage where he had dwelt since birth and would be a tragic severing of all ties with the past ; moreover , and a fact more potent than all the rest , it would mean dismantling the house of the web that for years he had spun , the symbols of dreams that had been his chief delight . Should he go to the Eldridges there could be no more inventing , for Jan 's wife was a hard , practical woman who had scant sympathy with Willie 's """""""" idees . """""""" Nevertheless one redeeming consideration must not be lost sight of -- she was a famous cook , a very famous cook ; and poor Willie , although he cared little what he ate , was incapable of concocting any food at all . But the strings , the strings ! No , to go to live with Jan and Mrs. Eldridge was not to be thought of . It was just at this psychological juncture , when Willie was choosing ' twixt flesh and spirit , that he saw Celestina Morton standing like a vision in the sunshine that spangled his doorway . She said she knew how lonely he must be and therefore she had come to make a friendly call and tidy up the house or mend for him anything that needed mending . With this simple introduction she had taken off her hat and coat , donned an ample blue - and - white pinafore , and set to work . Fascinated Willie watched her deft movements . Now and then she smiled at him but she did not speak and neither did he ; nor , he noticed , did she disturb his strings or comment on their inconvenience . When twilight came and the hour for her departure drew near Willie stationed himself before the peg from which dangled her shabby wraps and stubbornly refused to have her hat and cloak removed from the nail . There , figuratively speaking , they had hung ever since , the inventor reasoning that life without this paragon of capability was a wretched and profitless adventure . In justifying his sudden decision to Janoah Eldridge , Willie had merely explained that he had hired Celestina because she was so comfortable to have around , a recommendation at which Wilton would have jeered but which , perhaps , in the eyes of the Lord was quite as praiseworthy as that which her more hidebound but"	Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Willie Eld , Willie Eldie Eldie Eldie , Willie Eldie Eldie Eld , Willie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie Eldie , Willie , Willie , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willie Eldridge , Willi
cents stayed in his pocket as a sop to the superstition that no coin breeds no more coins . Stopping first to look in a moment at Weeping Willy Mangler 's , or at Reilly 's pool room for a glance at the racing chart , or to hear a bit of the talk missed through his enforced absence from Boyle 's , he would end at Hankins ' or McDonald 's , there to woo fortune with nothing at all to offer as oblation . But affairs did not reach this pass until after the first year . It was incredible that Magnolia Ravenal could so soon have adapted herself to the life in which she now moved . Yet it was explicable , perhaps , when one took into consideration her inclusive nature . She was interested , alert , eager — and still in love with Gaylord Ravenal . Her life on the rivers had accustomed her to all that was bizarre in humanity . Queenie and Jo had been as much a part of her existence as Elly and Schultzy . The housewives in the little towns , the Negroes lounging on the wharves , the gamblers in the river - front saloons , the miners of the coal belt , the Northern fruit - pickers , the boatmen , the Southern poor whites , the Louisiana aristocracy , all had passed in fantastic parade before her ambient eyes . And she , too , had marched in a parade , a figure as gorgeous , as colourful as the rest . Now , in this new life , she accepted everything , enjoyed everything with a naïveté that was , perhaps , her greatest charm . It was , doubtless , the thing that held the roving Ravenal to her . Nothing shocked her ; this was her singularly pure and open mind . She brought to this new life an interest and a curiosity as fresh as that which had characterized the little girl who had so eagerly and companionably sat with Mr. Pepper , the pilot , in the bright cosy glass - enclosed pilot house atop the old _ Creole Belle _ on that first enchanting trip down the Mississippi to New Orleans . To him she had said , “ What 's around that bend ? . . . Now what 's coming ? . . . How deep is it here ? . . . What used to be there ? . . . What island is that ? ” Mr. Pepper , the pilot , had answered her questions amply and with a feeling of satisfaction to himself as he beheld her childish hunger for knowledge being appeased . Now she said to her husband with equal eagerness : “ Who is that stout woman with the pretty yellow - haired girl ? What queer eyes they have ! . . . What does it mean when it says	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .
Carter turned to see what he was looking at . Giving me one amazed look , he rose to his feet and came over in my direction . “ In the name of God , Pelt , what have you been doing ? ” was his shocked question . I dropped into a chair and told him a drink of Scotch would be very agreeable . With one look at my face he hurried out of the room . In a second he returned with a bottle and , placing it on a stand , took three glasses from his pocket . Ranville 's eyes wore a questioning look , but he made no inquiries until I had finished my drink . Even then it was Carter who broke out : “ What happened , Pelt . ” Going into a long account of my experiences , I told them of the visit of the boy and my trip to the swamp . They said nothing until I spoke of the attack which had been made on me in the tower , and how the man had tried to throw me off the top . Here Ranville broke in to say dryly that from my looks he judged the man had succeeded . I nodded , and then told how I had struck the roof , and that the minister had let me into his house through the opening in his attic . When I had finished , Carter was silent a moment , then jumped to his feet and left the room . Ranville poured me out another drink , took a small one for himself and said : “ You struck something to - night , Pelt , but what it was I would give a good deal to know . ” Shaking my head , I sank back in the chair . All at once I realized how tired I was , and that I was terribly sore . Every bone in my body seemed to be aching , and each time I moved I found a new sore spot . My eyes fell on my suit — stained by the grass and smeared with dirt . But for the time being I was too tired to go to my room and change . When Carter returned , he came to my side and said : “ I just got hold of the chief , Pelt . It struck me that if there is anything in the swamp , the chief better see that no one gets it before the police do . I told him what the boy said to you — how he saw some one throw something away . He says that he has not been to the station to - night , and so does not know if the boy went down , as you told him to . ” He paused and went on . “ I told him just a wee	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
is , ” agreed Anny , as she took the rum from Hal , who nearly cried out as he saw her bright , eager face lifted to the foreigner 's . Dick took the tankard and drained it ; then he began to smile again and to twist the knife through and about his fingers with that peculiar , smooth movement his crew knew so well . The girl watched him for a second and then looked up at the clock . Why had not Nan come , she wondered ? “ ‘ Tis late , Captain , you will miss the tide an you do not hasten , ” she said . Dick 's eyelids dropped a little lower over his dark eyes , but his knife slipped through his fingers with a faster motion than before . Yet still he smiled , and when he spoke Anny thought that she had never heard so beautiful a voice . “ Ah ! señora , I would not leave the Island without that jewel which is mine by right , ” he said softly . “ Oh ! I had forgot , ” said Anny , feeling in her apron pocket , “ here is the ring , sir , I had it ready for you , ” and she drew out a little muslin packet , and unfolding it disclosed the flowered ring which he had given her . She held it out to him . Sue , who had been watching them , gasped at the sight of such a jewel , and looked at Anny wonderingly . The girl was over - lucky , she thought . Dick took the ring and slipped it over the blade of his knife ; it slid up to the hilt and there stuck , a band of gold and gems round the blue steel . “ You give it back to me ? ” he said , half to himself . “ You give it back to me ? No other woman has done so much , ” he added suddenly , looking at her with that peculiar smile playing round his lips . Then his voice dropped , and he said as though he had just realized something : “ But to no other woman have I given so much , ” and he laughed again , unpleasantly and yet so musically -- while the knife fairly sped through his slim , delicate fingers . Anny began to feel fairly sure of herself . Why should she wait for Nan to defy him , she thought ? Here he was , laughing and playing ; surely there would be no danger in telling him the truth . She leaned a little nearer to him and said very softly so that none of the others could hear : “ I would you would go , sir ; you have your ring ; what else remains ? ” The knife	, ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , ” he said softly , “ Oh , sir , ” he laughed softly .

if only our Matilda and he could---- ” Francis Myddleton fairly roared with fury . “ Peace with ye , designing woman , ” he shouted . “ Will I have my only daughter disposed of before my eyes ? Unfeeling mother ! Elizabeth , I am amazed at ye . ” Mistress Myddleton gulped with indignation . “ Francis , I am surprised at you . I disposing of your daughter ! Oh , you scandalous man ! Why ever was I married to such a lump of lying perfidy ? ” “ God knows ! ” said Master Myddleton bitterly . Mistress Elizabeth 's answering outbreak was checked by the sound of horses ' hoofs in the cobbled yard outside . “ There he is -- God help us , ” she had time to whisper , and then composing her features into an amiable smile went out to meet their unwelcome guest . Master Myddleton sat looking down at the fragments of his pipe : then he felt in his pocket and drew out a twist of tobacco which he smelt and rolled lovingly round his fingers . He sighed . “ Drat women and work , ” he said to the roaring fire which blazed , crackled , and spat as though it quite agreed with him . Master Thomas Playle sprang out of his saddle and threw his bridle rein to the grinning ostler who ran out to meet him , and then marched up to the front door and pulled the bell sharply . Mistress Myddleton was before him in an instant and so overwhelmed him with welcome and motherly concern for his wet , muddy condition that he had nothing to say for himself for a minute or so . The candlelight in the stone - flagged hall showed the newcomer to be a tall , rather handsome man , some seven and twenty years of age . Mistress Myddleton regarded him with approval and mentally summed up her daughter Matilda 's attractive qualities : the result seemed to please her , for she smiled and conducted him to the dining room . “ My husband hath a troubled foot , ” she was at some pains to explain , “ and prays you to pardon him for not being on the steps to meet you . ” Playle bowed coldly and followed his voluble hostess in silence . Master Myddleton looked up casually as they entered , and after returning the younger man 's bow without rising he bade his wife hasten the supper , and , after waiting until she was out of the room , motioned his guest to a comfortable chair on the opposite side of the hearth . “ His worship , the Mayor and his---- ” began the young man sententiously as he sat down and stretched out his high mud - caked boots to the friendly fire .

and deliberate , so much master of his feelings , for this once he had failed to govern an overmastering impulse . So Elisabeth Dollon was the workgirl he had saved the night before from the pursuit of the street patrol ! And Elisabeth believed that Jérôme Fandor , whom she had had time to recognize , was one of her assailants ! What cared he now for any further details Mme . Doulenques might have to give ? Elisabeth lived on the fifth floor , and thither he rushed , panting , filled with a frantic eagerness to proclaim his innocence to the woman he loved , to clear up this new , this fatal misunderstanding . While the portress , in sheer terror of the man 's strange behaviour , in the very middle of a conversation bolting away like a thief to dash up to her tenant 's rooms , was screaming hoarse , half - stifled cries for help , Jérôme Fandor sprang up the stairs four steps at a time . Yes , there on the fifth floor he saw to his left a door with a green bell - pull beside it . He rang a peal , so loud and peremptory he could hear someone on the other side of the door hurrying forward at a run . A voice , Elisabeth 's voice , challenged : “ Who 's there ? What 's wanted ? ” Fandor had a gleam of common sense , enough to make him disguise his voice : “ Someone from M. Moche 's to see Mlle . Elisabeth Dollon . ” There was a sound of a key turning in the lock and the door fell ajar , while Jérôme could faintly catch a confused clamour reaching him from the courtyard below . “ You want to see me , sir ? ” and cautiously the occupant of the flat — doubtless the young woman had been resting on her bed and had hurriedly thrown a _ peignoir _ round her — opened the door a little wider . Alas ! hardly had she cast eyes on the visitor before she turned livid and tried to pull the door to again , screaming : “ Help ! help ! ... you ... you , Fantômas ! ... Fandor ! ... I am undone ! ” Instinctively throwing his weight against the door , Fandor endeavoured to prevent the girl from shutting him out . “ For heaven 's sake , ” he prayed her , “ calm yourself!—yes , it is I ... I Fandor ! ... who loves you .... Listen to me , I beseech you ! ” But with a sudden , desperate effort , Elisabeth Dollon had dragged the door to again , not without giving vent to another cry of frantic terror : “ Help ! it is Fantômas ... Fantômas ! ” All this had occupied but a moment , and	” Elisabeth sprang to her feet , a frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , frantic , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he , he ,
of earthenware ollas of a good size . These were Indian pots of a dull yellow colour , with decorations of black and red . One of them had a thong about its mouth , and had been used as a waterbucket ; the other , which was still covered with its earthenware lid , contained parched corn , shrivelled to the dryness and toughness of split peas , but still food . There was nothing to show what the man had been . He was tall for an Indian ; the crucifix seemed against his being a miner or prospector . He may have been some hermit , or contemplative . Sard removed the ollas into the open . After a little search he found the spring where the hermit had got his drinking water . He made a fire and cooked what was left of the woodchuck with the parched corn , and took his bearings while the meal was cooking . In front of him the path of the fire still ran on along the valley . It was already far away , running in little bright flickers of flame , under driven - down smoke . To his left , on the line of his course , there was a mile of scrubless desert of sand and rock , without even a cactus or a prickly pear , stretching to the rocky bulk of the Sierra . By the Sierra , in the direction in which he wished to go , was a chasm or cleft or cañon , it could hardly be called a glen . It ran into the very heart of the hills , for a mile or two , as far as he could see , but beyond it there were crags with pine trees , and beyond those more crags , and beyond those , crags with snow and more crags . To his right he could see very little . Foothills shut in the line of sight on that side . Wherever he looked there was no sign of the works of man , there was desert , rock , desolation and death . Between sixty and seventy miles of unknown country still lay between him and the coast . With some tough tendrils which had escaped the fire he contrived slings for the two ollas . He was now equipped with bread and water for two days . As he judged that the chasm or cleft would give him an easier path into the hills , he set off towards it . As he drew near to its entrance , it looked like the entrance to hell . He remembered that he had read somewhere , or somebody had told him , that the Indians dreaded these clefts in the mountains , and said that unspeakable things lived in them . Now as he drew near the mouth , he heard far up the cañon something like a voice	                                                         
you not speak ? You heard my name . ” “ Remember I did not know your name , ” she said . “ I have always thought that your name was Chisholm . I never once heard you called Harker . You were Chisholm to me . ” “ Ah ! I was afraid of that , ” he said . “ You never got my letter ? ” “ Never . ” They were silent for a few seconds ; in the stillness some ash dropped from the fuse with a feathery fall : down in the town a cock crowed . “ Strange , ” he said . “ There is a cock crowing . I can not hear a cock without knowing that I have an immortal soul . ” “ It is a live cry , ” she said . “ It is like a trumpeter trumpeting the graves open . It 's the cry the dead will rise with . “ Ah ! ” he cried , bitterly . “ And the living are rising with it , and going out to their work , while we are lashed here like staysails . Oh , if I could only heave this pillar down ! ” He swayed from side to side , but was too tightly lashed : there was no stirring that tree bole tamped in four feet below the floor . “ It 's no good , ” he said . “ I am caught . And if I had not been a hasty fool , I could have come here with guardias and set you free . ” “ Do n't think that for an instant , ” she said . “ They were going to cut my throat if there were any rescue . ‘ We shall all die together , ' he told me . It 's death to him to be caught here , but he was determined that I should die first . Guardias would not have saved me . ” “ I have n't done much , ” he said . “ You have done everything , ” she said . The red glow on the fuse suddenly changed to yellowish ; a little flame sprang up out of the glow : it wavered like a candle - flame . “ The thing is going to explode , ” she said . “ I think so , it is bad fuse : it is burning . ” “ How long have we ? ” “ Perhaps less than a minute . ” “ Could you sing something ? ” The flame in the fuse suddenly brightened and lit up the room . He turned to Margarita and saw her great eyes fixed upon his . “ Here comes the burst , ” he said . “ Stand by . ” The flame steadied , then began to shoot higher with a steady sputtering hiss till it	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

dropped it . We 'll go in , if it is . Are you armed ? ” “ No ; are you ? ” “ No , ” Sard said , “ but I 'm used to rough houses . Are you ? ” “ No . ” “ Well , ” Sard said , “ there 's only one rule in rough house fighting , and that is , be first . Come on . ” * * * * * They crept to the door of the house . It looked more solid , close at hand . It had knopped iron plates across it : the fanlight was barred : the windows to each side were covered with old iron rejas . The house behind it was as silent as the grave . For a moment Sard thought of calling a civil guard , but put the thought from him , “ I 'm my own civil guard in a seaport town ; besides , this gang is certain to have squared the police . ” Both men listened : Sard tried the key . The key fitted and turned . Very gently , lest the door should be upon a chain , Sard moved it ajar . He peered in . There was a smell of some gum or incense , like the smell of sweet leather . There was an ample hall , dark as old leather , with patches of light from the windows . He saw then what he had not suspected from without , that the windows were of an opaque glass . He edged into the hall , followed by Hilary . They stood together , inside the door , listening intently . Sard felt along the door to make sure how to open it . “ It 's a latch door , ” he whispered . “ We 'd better close it . ” “ No , keep it open for our retreat , ” Hilary whispered . “ Too risky , ” he answered . “ It might slam to , or be noticed from outside , or make a draught that would be noticed inside . ” “ Better have a line of escape , ” Hilary said . “ We 'll prop it , then , ” Sard said . “ Or will you stand guard while I explore ? ” “ No fear , ” Hilary answered , “ I 'm going to find my sister . ” “ Come on , then , ” Sard said . “ We 'll prop it . ” There was a mat just within the door .

called her up . Get this man Ballau , now , gentlemen , upset by his infatuation for the girl , preparing for the hour when he must surrender all hope of her , mixed up , crazy . And he telephones her . He ca n't stand it any longer . He tells her over the phone that he must see her . She answers evasively , ‘ Yes ... yes . ' And he goes on pleading . And finally he plays his trump card . He tells her unless she renounces De Medici he 'll expose the relations that have existed between them — between Ballau and his supposed daughter . Relations , let us say , before you entered her life , Mr. De Medici . “ Well , he was going to do this thing publicly . It was a cowardly act . But , mind you , the sort of threat a man of his age driven to despair by his infatuation would make . And she rushed home . There were yet two hours to ward off the thing he threatened . She rushed home , beside herself , to appeal to his better side , to plead with him and weep and entreat him . The disgrace he had threatened her with on the eve of her engagement party was enough to make any young woman go wild . You can imagine what followed as easily as I can , ” he concluded , “ her pleading , his excitement , her tears , his offers , and , disgrace staring her in the face , her hysteria and the murder . ” Dr. Lytton regarded De Medici . “ What do you think of it ? ” he asked . De Medici 's head was lowered . His narrow eyes , half closed , were contemplating the floor . “ Nothing , ” he answered softly . “ A persuasive cock and bull story . ” Norton grew irritable . “ I called you here to see if you would assist me , ” he said . “ I want to know how she acted the morning you proposed to her . Did she say anything about Ballau ? ” “ Nothing , ” answered De Medici , “ except that she knew he would be overjoyed . ” Norton nodded and looked grim . De Medici , studying the floor , was thinking . “ She was nervous . Yes , I remember something ... about Ballau . Her manner changed . She asked what he had said ... two or three times . And she wept when I left her .... White - faced and weeping in front of the theater .... Preposterous ! Not Florence . There 's something else . This creature paws clumsily with surfaces .... ” The voice of Dr. Lytton interrupted his musings . “ You have n't finished , I hope , ”	De Medici , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah eton , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici 
man simply to disappear without reaping the profits of his crimes ? ” “ Why , no ! ” “ Then , my dear man , all we have to do is to go to the grand duchess 's , to Lady Beltham 's , to seek the organizer of the famous subscription . It is heavy odds , do n't you see ? that Tom Bob , before disappearing , will want to get hold of the moneys collected for his benefit . The strong - box where they are locked up , that is the decoy , the bait , that is bound to attract him powerfully ; it is beside it we must take him in our toils . ” “ Or shoot him down like a noxious wild beast , ” concluded Fandor , brandishing his Browning . * * * * * M. Landais , Minister of Justice , was that morning at nine o'clock clad in a very summary costume . Wearing a long dressing - gown , gaping open over his chest , his naked feet thrust into a pair of slippers , unshaven , and only half awake , he was seated on his desk in his official rooms in the Rue Franklin ; he held his telephone receiver in one hand , he was driving his secretaries frantic with a hundred contradictory orders , while at the same time worrying the unfortunate girl on duty at the Exchange out of her life . “ Hello ! ” called the Minister , “ I 'm asking you to put me through to the Prefecture . The Prefecture of Police ? Yes ! that 's plain enough , surely ; _ ca n't _ you understand ? ” Then he dropped the receiver , and swearing out loud a terrific oath , he yelled , as if to somebody behind the scenes : “ But , hell and damnation ! the thing 's outrageous ! Havard has not been told about it ! Else he 'd be here ! ” “ You must remember , sir , ” observed a valet , who at M. Landais ' summons had cautiously half opened the door , “ it is barely a quarter of an hour since they went for him . If M. Havard was still in bed ... ” “ Well , he had only to get up , eh ? _ I_'ve got up , have n't I ? ... ” But the Minister stopped abruptly ; he had just got connection with the Prefecture of Police : “ Hello ! ” he called , “ well , what news ? ... What ? ... What 's that you tell me ? Juve is dead ? Good Lord ! you are simply mad ! ... You do n't know ? They never do know anything at the Prefecture !

Oh , nothing much . It was some rag of that bounder Coghill 's , I think . They said he was planning to get a rise out of us . ” “ Do you mean Mr. Colin Coghill ? ” “ Yes . ” “ He went up the coast to San Felipe three days ago . His brother has just died there . ” “ How do you know ? ” “ Mrs. Pennington told me . ” “ Oh , well , it was some other fellow 's rag , then . ” “ He did not look to me to be the sort of man concerned in a rag . You say that his name was Harker ? It seemed to me that I had met him somewhere . His face seemed familiar . Wo n't you tell me what the rag is or was to be ? ” “ Yes , Margarita , of course ; but it seems so absurd . ” He told her in outline what Sard had said , omitting anything which might frighten her . He made his tale as light as possible , but he saw that she became very grave . “ Why are you so solemn , Pearl ? ” “ I was thinking of what you said . ” “ Do you think that it is anything but a rag ? ” “ Yes , I do , Hilary . The man who came here this evening was in earnest . ” “ You did not see him . ” “ Yes , I did . I saw him in the garden . I noticed him very particularly , because I thought for a moment that he was someone else , a Mr. Chisholm . The only thing which puzzles me is the lack of motive . Why should burglars come here ? There is nothing to steal here . ” “ It is that which makes me think it is all a rag . ” “ There was a case in Greece last Christmas of English people being kidnapped and held to ransom . We might be the . . . the swag , in this case . ” “ Mr. Harker thought that the people were not burglars nor bandits , but rum - runners from Santa Barbara .

came on . Doc began to light the auditorium kerosene lamps whose metal reflectors sent back their yellow glow . Outside the kerosene search - light , cunningly rigged on top of the _ Mollie Able 's _ pilot house , threw its broad beam up the river bank to the levee . Of all the hours in the day this was the one most beloved of Magnolia 's heart . She enjoyed the stir , the colour , the music , the people . Anything might happen on board the Cotton Blossom Floating Palace Theatre between the night hours of seven and eleven . And then it was that she was banished to bed . There was a nightly struggle in which , during the first months of their life on the rivers , Mrs. Hawks almost always won . Infrequently , by hook or crook , Magnolia managed to evade the stern parental eye . “ Let me just stay up for the first act — where Elly shoots him . ” “ Not a minute . ” “ Let me stay till the curtain goes up , then . ” “ You march yourself off to bed , young lady , or no trip to the pirate 's cave to - morrow with Doc , and so I tell you . ” Doc 's knowledge of the gruesome history of river banditry and piracy provided Magnolia with many a goose - skinned hour of delicious terror . Together they went excursioning ashore in search of the blood - curdling all the way from Little Egypt to the bayous of Louisiana . Lying there in her bed , then , wide - eyed , tense , Magnolia would strain her ears to catch the words of the play 's dialogue as it came faintly up to her through the locked door that opened on the balcony ; the almost incredibly naïve lines of a hackneyed play that still held its audience because of its full measure of fundamental human emotions . Hate , love , revenge , despair , hope , joy , terror . “ I will bring you to your knees yet , my proud beauty ! ” “ Never . I would rather die than accept help from your blood - stained hand . ” Once Parthy , warned by some maternal instinct , stole softly to Magnolia 's room to find the prisoner flown . She had managed to undo the special lock with which Mrs. Hawks had thought to make impossible her little daughter 's access to the upper veranda deck just off her room . Magnolia had crept around the perilously narrow ledge enclosed by a low railing just below the upper deck and was there found , a shawl over her nightgown , knitted bed - slippers on her feet , peering in at the upper windows together with adventuresome and indigent urchins of the town who had managed somehow to	” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” 
of his foe . But lo ! he now found himself once more the prey of his savage adversary ! For Juve felt no doubt the wound in his arm , the distress that tormented his whole body , were Fantômas ' work . Fantômas had accomplices inside the prison , and it was these confederates who had come at night to make a cut on his arm as if he had been wounded , after first sending him to sleep by means of the drug the debilitating effects of which he still experienced . With what object had they so acted ? He did not know and he could not guess , ponder the matter as he might . But at least the fact was certain , undeniable , and it put the crown on his calamity ! Fantômas had accomplices in his prison ! The thought never ceased tormenting the unhappy man with ever increasing intensity , when suddenly a new idea struck him that made him spring up joyfully from his chair and stride up and down his narrow cell . “ If Fantômas has accomplices in the prison , I am bound to know them , these same accomplices , they must come in contact with me every day , ” thought Juve : “ but if I know them , it will be possible for me to detect them and confound their plans . What was the saddest feature of my position was that I was powerless , and could expect the discovery of the truth only from the efforts of others . Now I am going to work for myself , and deep as the mystery may be , I shall clear it up , just because I am so resolved to do so . ” Juve was at this point in his reflections when M. Havard entered his cell . At sight of his old Chief the prisoner made a movement of recoil . The Head of the Criminal Bureau pretended not to see this and took a seat on a stool ; then he signed to the two warders , who since morning had been permanently stationed in the cell , to withdraw , and when they had shut the door behind them , he began in these terms : “ Juve , since this morning , a grave suspicion rests upon you ; the wound you have on your arm is a very damning proof of your guilt . ” Juve was persuaded that M. Havard was the prime mover in his ruin , so that the friendship and devotion he bore his Chief previously to his imprisonment had been succeeded by something of rancour . “ Sir , ” he replied , “ you think you have been clever enough already to discover many indications of my guilt ; I make no doubt you will be ingenious enough to discover many more . What I am afraid of is that	                                                          
without success , for accident had followed on flood . Captain Andy had tracked down a stout and reluctant midwife who consented only after an enormous bribe to make the perilous trip to the levee , clambering ponderously down the slippery bank with many groanings and forebodings , and being sustained , both in bulk and spirit , by the agile and vivacious little captain much as a tiny fussy river tug guides a gigantic and unwieldy ocean liner . He was almost frantically distraught , for between Andy Hawks and his daughter Magnolia Ravenal was that strong bond of affection and mutual understanding that always exists between the henpecked husband and the harassed offspring of a shrew such as Parthy Ann Hawks . When , an hour later , Gaylord Ravenal , rain - soaked and mud - spattered , arrived with a white - faced young doctor 's assistant whose first obstetrical call this was , he found the fat midwife already in charge and inclined to elbow about any young medical upstart who might presume to dictate to a female of her experience . It was a sordid and ravaging confinement which , at its climax , teetered for one dreadful moment between tragedy and broad comedy . For at the crisis , just before dawn , the fat midwife , busy with ministrations , had said to the perspiring young doctor , “ D'you think it 's time to snuff her ? ” Bewildered , and not daring to show his ignorance , he had replied , judicially , “ Uh — not just yet .

Actually she was having a rich , care - free , and varied life such as she had never dreamed of and of which she secretly was enamoured . Dwellers in this or that river town loitering down at the landing to see what manner of sin and loose - living went on in and about this show boat with its painted women and play - acting men would be startled to hear sounds and sniff smells which were identical with those which might be issuing that very moment from their own smug and godly dwellings ashore . From out the open doors of the Cotton Blossom Floating Palace Theatre came the unmistakable and humdrum sounds of scales and five - finger exercises done painfully and unwillingly by rebellious childish hands . Ta - ta - ta—_TA_—ta - ta - ta . From below decks there floated up the mouth - watering savour of tomato ketchup , of boiling vinegar and spices , or the perfumed aroma of luscious fruits seething in sugary kettles . “ Smells for all the world like somebody was doing up sweet pickles . ” One village matron to another . “ Well , I suppose they got to eat like other folks . ” Ta - ta - ta—_TA_—ta - ta - ta . It was inevitable , however , that the ease and indolence of the life , as well as the daily contact with odd and unconventional characters must leave some imprint on even so adamantine an exterior as Parthy 's . Little by little her school - teacherly diction dropped from her . Slowly her vowels began to slur , her aren'ts became ain'ts , her crisp new England utterance took on something of the slovenly Southern drawl , her consonants were missing from the end of a word here and there . True , she still bustled and nagged , managed and scolded , drove and reproached . She still had the power to make Andy jump with nervousness . Whether consciously or unconsciously , the influence of this virago was more definitely felt than that of any other one of the _ Cotton Blossom 's _ company and crew . Of these only Julie Dozier , and Windy , the pilot ( so called because he almost never talked ) actually triumphed over Mrs. Hawks . Julie 's was a negative victory . She never voluntarily spoke to Parthy and had the power to aggravate that lady to the point of frenzy by remaining limp , supine , and idle when Parthy thought she should be most active ; by raising her right eyebrow quizzically in response to a more than usually energetic tirade ; by the habitual disorder of the tiny room which she shared with Steve ; by the flagrant carelessness and untidiness of her own	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
stuttered and groaned up the steep hill sides . It had forded creeks , the horses splashing soberly through them and sending the spray into the air on either side . It had crashed over the undergrowth that encroached on the track , an ill - blazed stock route among the trees , and again and again the man had been obliged to haul aside fallen timber , or burn it where it lay , and cut away saplings , in order to make a new path . The wagon was filled with boxes and bags of food stuffs and pieces of furniture . Inside it smelt like a grocer 's shop ; and it had trailed the mingled odour of meal , corned meat , hemp , iron , seed wheat , crude oil and potatoes through the virgin purity of the forest air . Beneath its floor , in wrappings of torn bags , straw and hessian , were lashed a wooden plough , a broad - bladed shovel , and half a dozen farming and carpentering tools . The fowls -- a game rooster , a buff hen and a speckled pullet -- hung in wicker baskets from wooden pegs at the back . They and the cow and her calf had wakened strange echoes in the forest , the rooster heralding every morning at dawn this advance guard of civilisation . When the vehicle had reached the summit of the foothills , the track fell wavering into the green depths of the forest behind it , a wale of broken ferns , slain saplings , blue gums and myrtles , mown down as with a scythe by its wheels . The timbered hills fell away , wave upon wave , into the mists of the distance , and the plains stretched outward from them to the faintly glittering line the sea made on the dim horizon . Somewhere to the west on those grey plains , against the shore of an inlet , was the township of Port Southern from which they had come . Donald Cameron , after studying a roughly - made plan and the wall of the forest about him , had taken the mare by her sandy forelock and turned the wagon in among the trees on the far side of a giant gum , blazed with a cross , on which the congealing sap had dried like blood . Steering a north - westerly course , the wagon had tacked among the trees and come to the clearing . And now that all preparations for the night were made , he took the animals to the creek for water . It ran at the foot of the long , low hillside and could be heard crooning and gurgling under the leafy murmur of the forest .

should not be left in peace that morning to sleep off the effects of his last night 's indulgence . In defiance of the established customs of the house , hitherto invariably respected , the door , without leave given , was half opened . A head appeared , a face of consternation , the head and face of his servant John . Ascott , who at the moment was making for the bed , turned sharply round and sitting down on the coverlet , addressed the domestic in angry tones : “ What ever has come to you , John what do you want ? I have n't rung , that I know of . ” For all that the man pushed into the room and advanced some steps nearer his master . “ Forgive me , sir , ” he murmured , “ I should never have dared to come into your bedroom , sir , without being summoned , but there 's someone wishing to ... ” Ascott stifled a yawn , signifying by a peremptory wave of the hand his refusal to hear another word . “ You are mad , John ; you know perfectly well I never receive visitors at this hour of the day . ” “ Excuse me , sir , but it seems it is important . ” “ Nothing is important enough to wake me up for , ” declared Ascott . But the servant went on with extraordinary and unprecedented persistency . “ It is the old fellow who sometimes comes to see you , sir , the business agent , your lawyer , sir , old M. Moche . I explained you could not see him , sir , but he insisted all the same , he almost forced me to come up here ... please excuse me , sir , but ... ” His master was furious . Calling up , not without difficulty , all the will power he possessed , all the energy he was capable of that morning , he vociferated passionately : “ I will _ not _ see him and if the old chap insists , chuck him out of the house ! ” Ascott had hardly uttered the words before a grave and dignified voice was heard in the anteroom adjoining the bed - chamber , and at the same moment there issued from the shadows , pushing his way into the room , someone whose identity could admit of no mistake even to the Englishman 's sleepy eyes . It was in fact M. Moche coming in , in defiance of all prohibition . Dressed , as always , in his long , black frock - coat , holding in his hand his tall hat with the dulled , dented surface , M. Moche showed dirtier and still more repulsive - looking in the broad light of day than by candlelight , but also more solemn and more majestic .	, ” he murmured passionately , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir

He had been with them on several of their wanderings , and Deirdre and he had always seemed to get on like brother and sister together , he thought .

The way she laughed and moved were a revelation to him . """""""" So Deirdre 's a woman and at woman 's tricks , """""""" he thought . She had been a child to him till this night . Conal with his sunburnt , bearded face , his rough hands , his eyes , bright with love and laughter , had made a woman of her , he told himself . And what had she made of him ? The Schoolmaster saw his eyes on her neck where the dark curls gathered dewily . He knew as much as there was to be known of Long Conal , knew that he had flirted and drunk and sworn his way along all the stock routes in the country . He had kissed and ridden away times without number . But there was something else in his eyes now , something that promised he would never want to ride far , or long , from the sight of Deirdre . The Schoolmaster was sure of that . For a moment he saw the girl 's averted face , the curve of her white neck , the little tendrils of hair clustering moist and jetty about her ears , her scarlet fluttering lips , as Conal might have seen them . """""""" She 's a beautiful woman -- Deirdre . """""""" An uneasily - moving voice jerked suddenly behind him with sly , chuckling laughter . It was Thad McNab who spoke .

McNab came and stood in Mrs. Mary Ann 's doorway sometimes when there was dancing , and the joy of several of the dancers was quenched at the mere sight of his shrivelled yellow face and pale eyes .

Then she laughed a little unnaturally and rubbed her hand awkwardly down the sides of her skirt . “ Oh , of course not , ” she said , laughing still on a strange high pitch , as she gathered up the finery and put it carefully back into the sail - cloth covering . “ Of course not , ” she repeated mechanically , never allowing her fingers to stray over the smooth soft surface of the silk or to play amongst the amber beads or ivory ornaments . “ There , ” she said at last as the last trinket was slipped into the little box , and she looked round , the bright colour still in her cheeks and the forced smile on her lips . “ Oh ! and the little beast ? ” she said half questioningly , half agreeing , as she picked up the little carved elephant and looked at it wistfully . “ And the little beast , ” said Hal firmly . Anny sighed and slipped it in with the others , then tied up the sail - cloth with a firm hand . “ Master de Musset , ” she said a little unsteadily , “ would you be kind enough to -- to take this back to the Captain and say I ca n't accept it ?

Anny stepped forward quickly and laid her hand on his arm , anxiety written in her very posture . “ Oh , nay !

Pet hobbled off to obey him without a word , and Dick turned to his mate in something like admiration . “ You have been well schooled , friend , ” he said approvingly . “ Yours is an excellent way of dealing with crones . ” “ Have a care ! ” called Pet from above as she threw the rope ladder over the side . The end passed within an inch of Blueneck 's shoulders and he looked up angrily . Pet was leering at him from the deck . “ Come up , ronyon , ” she said coaxingly . Blueneck scaled the ladder in a minute and clambered on to the rolling deck beside her . Dick followed , more dignified but not a whit less agile . Once on deck he looked about him in disgust . The worm - eaten boards , the empty kegs and other lumber , and the general filthiness of the place disgusted the little Spaniard . His own brig was always kept neat and fastidiously clean . He shrugged his shoulders . “ A very vile place in truth , ” he observed , and then , turning to Pet , he raised his hat as gallantly as if she had been a duenna . “ I would descend and talk with thee on the shore , if you please , mistress , ” he said . “ This ship distresses me . ” He went again to the ladder , picking his way daintily across the dirty deck ; slowly he climbed down again . Pet and Blueneck followed him without a word on to the sand again . “ Prithee , mistress , be seated , ” said Dick , indicating a bank of seaweed and seating himself on a breakwater some four feet away . Pet sat down heavily and looked from Dick to Blueneck in a half - witted , puzzled way , her big loose mouth sagging open , on one side showing the large yellow teeth , which so irritated Blueneck . Suddenly she stretched out a bony hand toward Black'erchief Dick and began in a droning whine : “ May the Lord bless ye , fine gentleman ; could ye spare a drop o ' rum for a poor woman to take to her man who is dying of cold ?

The vision of Hal 's hurt and angry face kept rising up before her . “ And if I do not we d him what will you do ? ” she said at last . “ Bewitch you , girl , so that even your young slave , Hal , may loathe you , ” Pet began in a slow sing - song voice . “ So that your beautiful black hair may fall off on the sand like seaweed , leaving you old and hairless -- so that your eyes may burn up and grow dim and the sight of the sea never more be seen in them -- so that your teeth may grow black and ache with the pain of ten thousand devils tearing at their roots -- so that your nails may drop off and lie on the floor like shells , and your fingers wither and grow black , and their knuckles decay and the joints drop off , and---- ” Anny covered her eyes . “ Oh , peace -- peace , I pray you , ” she screamed . “ I will do anything .

Send Hal Grame and you to Colchester to the Castle to rot your lives out in the foul dungeons they have there . ” This was the last . Anny , who was by this time thoroughly frightened , had been brought up along with the other Island children to fear Colchester Castle worse than death , and , indeed , the stories of the dungeons current at that time were very terrible , the civil war being only just over .

for this crime he had committed . He would stop at nothing . Instinctively , she felt that he would destroy her and himself , rather than be taken . Certainly , he would not hesitate to murder Ralph if the opportunity presented itself . She flung herself upon the couch , and burst into tears of agony , and terror . Suddenly she sprang to her feet , still sobbing , wide - eyed with dread of what she knew not . The space flyer had stopped . The throb of the machinery had stilled and the flyer was hanging motionless in space . Standing in the middle of the room , rigid with suspense , Alice waited with beating heart . Suddenly she heard the sound of rapid steps on the stairs . Now they halted at the door , and someone fumbled at the bolts and locks . The next instant the door was flung wide open , and Llysanorh ' the Martian stood upon the threshold ! 14 THE TERROR OF THE COMET During the next few days Ralph passed midway between Earth and Venus . This was the spectacle that at times greatly increased the transport space flyer travel between Earth and Mars , many of the inhabitants of both planets making the long journey simply to get a view of the beautiful planet Venus . Ralph ran almost parallel for a time with the two planets ( see diagram ) , Venus to his left , Earth to his right . Although he was quite near the former he could hardly see it , as the bright rays of the sun precluded detailed observation . A few days later , however , it had swung sufficiently far enough to the left to afford him occasional glimpses of its beauties . Ralph worked almost continuously in his laboratory in the conning tower . In the course of the week since he had left the Earth , he had only catnapped for about two hours , since sleep was impossible . He constructed several new pieces of apparatus , which he considered might be useful in case of a possible encounter with Llysanorh ' . He knew that Llysanorh ' could not be as easily subdued or caught as Fernand . This tall Martian was an inventor himself and knew much about handling modern death - dealing weapons . It would be useless to try the Radioperforer as he probably would carry a Silonium armor , proof against all Radium emanations . One of the first things he had done was to lead wires from the steering apparatus up to the conning tower . On the floor of the tower he arranged contacts in such a manner that he could press them together with his feet . The control was similar to the foot pedals of an organ . He then practised for some days until he could steer the flyer wholly with his feet .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

I meant to have bought some for it only this afternoon , but like an ass I forgot . ” “ Then we have n't any firearms ? ” “ None that we can fire . We could use them as bluffs . And there 's a machete here , that Ramón cuts vines with . ” “ Very well , then . Take that . Now , light up a torch and let us start . ” They rolled up some copies of _ La Nacion _ as torches and lit one of them while they examined the outer steps . They called loudly , “ Tia Eusebia ! Ho , Tia Eusebia ! ” but had no reply . They came down the steps into the drive , by the light of the flaming newspapers , which Margaret lit one by one as they proceeded . Small things crossing their track , scared by the light , reassured them , since their presence showed that no strangers had passed that way recently . It was dark night now . The shrubbery through which they passed glistened like a lot of eyes . The depth of the wood beyond was so ugsome , that it was a pleasure to them to turn the curve in the drive and see the light from the open door of the lodge . Hilary called aloud , “ Tia Eusebia ! ” and “ Lotta ! ” but no answer came from the lodge or from the wood . “ There is something not quite right here , ” Margaret said . “ Jorge ! Marianela ! Even the children do not answer . ” “ We will soon find what is amiss . Hola ! Tia Eusebia !

had been known to give a really devout Catholic captain a severe and instantaneous case of chills and fever . Her letters to Magnolia were characteristic : Well , Maggie , I hope you and the child are in good health . Often and often I think land knows what kind of a bringing up she is getting with the life you are leading . I can imagine . Well , you made your own bed and now you can lie in it . I have no doubt that he has run through every penny of your money that your poor father worked so hard to get as I predicted he would . I suppose you heard all about French 's _ New Sensation _ . French has the worst luck it does seem . She sank six weeks ago at Medley 's just above New Madrid . The fault of the pilot it was . Carelessness if ever I heard it . He got caught in the down draft of a gravel bar and snagged her they say . I think of your poor pa and how he met his end . It took two weeks to raise her though she was only in six feet of water . On top of that his other boat the _ Golden Rod _ you remember went down about four weeks ago in the Illinois near Hardin . A total loss . Did you ever hear of such luck . Business is pretty good . I ca n't complain . But I have to be right on hand every minute or they would steal me blind and that 's the truth . I have got a new heavy . No great shakes as an actor but handy enough and a pretty good black face in the concert and they seem to like him . We had a pretty rough audience all through the coal country but whenever it looked like a fight starting I 'd come out in front and stand there a minute and say if anybody started anything I would have the boat run out into the middle of the river and sink her . That I 'd never had a fight on my boat and was n't going to begin any such low life shenanigans now . ( Magnolia got a swift mental picture of this menacing , black - garbed figure standing before the gay crude curtain , the footlights throwing grim shadows on her stern face . That implacable woman was capable of cowering even a tough coal - belt audience bent on a fight . ) Crops are pretty good so business is according . I put up grape jelly last week . A terrible job but I ca n't abide this store stuff made of gelatine or something and no real grapes in it .

the war , and some of the more powerful unions had taken the general rise in prices as an excuse for demanding higher wages . This naturally had made the members of the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants ' and Manufacturers ' Association indignant , and now they saw their chance to use these returned soldiers to smash strikes and to break the organizations of the labor men . They proceeded to organize the soldiers for this purpose ; in American City the Chamber of Commerce contributed twenty - five thousand dollars to furnish the club - rooms for them , and when the trolley men went on strike the cars were run by returned soldiers in uniform . There was one veteran , a fellow by the name of Sydney , who objected to this program . He was publishing a paper , the “ Veteran 's Friend , ” and began to use the paper to protest against his comrades acting as what he called “ scabs . ” The secretary of the Merchants ' and Manufacturers ' Association sent for him and gave him a straight talking to , but he went right ahead with his campaign , and so Guffey 's office was assigned the task of shutting him up . Peter , while he could not take an active part in the job , was the one who guided it behind the scenes . They proceeded to plant spies in Sydney 's office , and they had so many that it was really a joke ; they used to laugh and say that they trod on one another 's toes . Sydney was poor , and had not enough money to run his paper , so he accepted any volunteer labor that came along . And Guffey sent him plenty of volunteers -- no less than seven operatives -- one keeping Sydney 's books , another helping with his mailing , two more helping to raise funds among the labor unions , others dropping in every day or two to advise him . Nevertheless Sydney went right ahead with his program of denouncing the Merchants ' and Manufacturers ' Association , and denouncing the government for its failure to provide farms and jobs for the veterans . One of Guffey 's “ under cover operatives”--that was the technical term for the Peter Gudges and Joe Angells -- was a man by the name of Jonas . This Jonas called himself a “ philosophic anarchist , ” and posed as the reddest Red in American City ; it was his habit to rise up in radical meetings and question the speaker , and try to tempt him to justify violence and insurrection and “ mass - action . ” If he repudiated these ideas , then Jonas would denounce him as a “ mollycoddle , ” a “ pink tea Socialist , ” a “ labor faker . ” Other people in the audience would	' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' 
_ _ As naught in the world is sweet Anny to me . _ ” The rich musical voice echoed round the old boat and floated out over the marshes . Anny caught her breath and her grip on the Spaniard 's pulsing white hand tightened . She was carried out of herself by the excitement of the moment , the wonderful frock , the jewels , and above all the singing . Dick felt her emotion , and his arm slid round her waist much like a snake slips round a tree stem , and , as her pretty head fell back on his shoulder , the song grew louder , sweeter , and a triumphant note crept into it . “ _ So gentle , so tender , so wise without guile , _ _ Oh , where is another like Ann of the Isle ? _ ” Anny sighed deliriously and she shivered with pure excitement ; the Spaniard 's full red lips brushed her hair before the wonderful voice rang out again in the chorus : “ _ Ann , Oh ! Ann of the Island , _ _ Where is another like Ann of the Isle ? _ ” The crew took up the strain , and Dick and Anny stood together in a circle of singing men , each with his rumkin held high above his head and his foot keeping time to the rhythm . Old Pet spat on the deck and an envious light came into her evil old face . All her life she had longed to be the centre of a scene like this , the magnet of an admiring crowd of hard - drinking , hard - fighting , hard - loving men . All her youth had been spent in dreams of a night like this . Now in her age it was bitter to see it come to another woman . As for Anny , she was intoxicated with it all ; any sense of prudence had left her . She was supremely happy . Now and again a faint regret that she could not marry Hal rose in her mind , but she dismissed it promptly . The future had no being for her , and the past was a dream ; the thing that counted was the present , the laughing , pulsing , living present . And as the _ Anny 's _ crew roared out their captain 's own love - song , and Dick , his Spanish blood on fire with love triumphant , kissed her hair , her eyes , and mouth , she laughed as freely and as joyously as he had done . The shadows were deepening by this time and the deep blue sky was studded with stars , and Anny , looking up from the Captain 's shoulder , said suddenly : “ It is late , sir ; I must go back to the Ship now	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

For three years this experiment of Ralph 124C 41 + had been the subject of innumerable scientific papers , had been discussed intermittently in the newspapers and the date of the final phase of the great experiment was fixed in the mind of every human being on the planet . If the experiment succeeded it meant the prolongation of human life over greater periods of the earth 's history than had ever been possible . It meant that premature death except through accident would be ended . Would he succeed ? Had he attempted the impossible ? Was he challenging Nature to a combat only to be worsted ? These thoughts obtruded themselves into his consciousness as he began the preparations for the great test of the afternoon . He pumped out the Permagatol from the box until the green vapor had completely disappeared . With infinite care he then forced a small quantity of oxygen into the box . The instruments recording the action of the respiratory organs indicated that the oxygen reaching the dog 's lungs had stimulated respiration . This being all he could do for the present , he pressed the button that raised the glass barrier , and summoned Peter by means of another button . That individual , looking a trifle more melancholy than usual , responded at once .

, let it wait , ” she said , tossing her head . “ It can wait till Doomsday before you 'll see me aboard , ” and she broke into a little nervous laugh . To her surprise Dick joined in with her , and his long , low laugh echoed through the kitchen . Hal looked up quickly and then turned away as though the sight had stung him , while Gilbot , thinking that it was a signal for general joyfulness , began to sing again : “ _ Pretty Poll , she loved a sailor , _ _ And well she loved he---- _ ” “ Peace , damn you , peace , ” roared Dick , suddenly gripping Anny 's arm so hard that she cried out . Gilbot sat spellbound . Never had any one so spoken to him in his life before , and he was about to reply , but one look at the furious face of the little Spaniard calmed him and he subsided , muttering : “ No offensh , no offensh . ” This outburst had surprised Anny quite as much as Gilbot , and she looked at Dick with new fear . If only Nan would come , she thought , if only Nan would come ! At this moment the door opened and she turned eagerly , her eyes alight with hope , but it was Sue who came in softly and sat down quietly by the fireside opposite her uncle . Dick turned his head without letting Anny go , and called for more rum . Hal brought it , without looking at either of them , and set it on the table . The Spaniard drained it at a gulp . “ So you will not come with me , my beautiful one ? ” he said , still smiling , and leaning across the table toward the girl . Anny looked at him and her spirits rose ; he was only playing with her , after all , she thought , as she saw his dark eyes smiling at her . Yet she wished that Nan would come , although she was still vague in her mind as to what she expected the old woman to do when she did come . “ Nay , sir , ” she said , smiling , “ not this time . ” The Spaniard laughed again . “ Not this time , my Ann ? Not this time ? ” he questioned in an almost threatening note , which crept into his laughing tone . “ Here , boy , more rum , ” he called over his shoulder . Hal brought the liquor ; the Spaniard drew his knife from his belt and held it up by the blade so that the flickering light fell on its jewelled hilt . “ ‘ Tis a fair blade , ” he said admiringly . “ Ay , it	Anny sah es , es sah es , es sah es , es sah es , es sah es , es sah es , es sah es , es sah es , es sah es , es sa , he sat , sat in the kitchen , sat at the table , sat at the table , sat at the table , sat at the table , sat at the table , sat at the table , sat at the table , and sat at the table , sat at the table , the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
' rights , meet me-- ” And then she stopped . “ Where ? ” “ In the studios , ” put in Peter . And Nell wrote , “ In the studios . Is that enough ? ” “ Room 17 . ” Peter knew that this was the room of Nikitin , a Russian painter who called himself an Anarchist . So Nell wrote “ Room 17 , ” and after further discussion she added : “ Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock . No names and no talk . Action ! ” This time was set because Peter recollected that there was to be a gathering of the “ wobblies ” in their headquarters this very evening . It was to be a business meeting , but of course these fellows never got together very long without starting the subject of “ tactics . ” There was a considerable element among them who were dissatisfied with what they called the “ supine attitude ” of the organization , and were always arguing for action . Peter was sure he would be able to get some of them interested in the idea of a dynamite conspiracy . As it turned out , Peter had no trouble at all ; the subject was started without his having to put in a word . Were the workers to be driven like sheep to the slaughter , and the “ wobblies ” not to make one move ? So asked the “ Blue - eyed Angell , ” vehemently , and added that if they were going to move , American City was as good a place as any . He had talked with enough of the rank and file to realize that they were ready for action ; all they needed was a battle - cry and an organization to guide them . Henderson , the big lumber - jack , spoke up . That was just the trouble ; you could n't get an organization for such a purpose . The authorities would get spies among you , they would find out what you were doing , and drive you underground . “ Well , ” cried Joe , “ we 'll go underground ! ” “ Yes , ” agreed the other , “ but then your organization goes bust . Nobody knows who to trust , everybody 's accusing the rest of being a spy . ” “ Hell ! ” said Joe Angell . “ I 've been in jail for the movement , I 'll take my chances of anybody 's calling me a spy . What I 'm not going to do is to sit down and see the workers driven to hell , because I 'm so damn careful about my precious organization . ” When others objected , Angell rushed on still more vehemently . Suppose they did fail in a mass - uprising , suppose they were driven to assassination and terrorism	” he cried vehemently . ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ”

When I know nothing myself , who can see ? ” He hesitated again and then smiled tiredly at the retreating animal . “ Not I , Francesca . No , it was another . I 've committed no murder .

The dark dream cringes under memories . But there was no duality . No , it was not I. Yet to others and to myself I act the part of a murderer . I grow furtive . My words became cautious .

nor hand - hold . “ If that should come down , ” he said , “ I shall be gulfed , like that man in the _ Venturer _ who got under the wheat - tip in the hold and was n't heard of till we got the hatches off in Hamburg five months later . But with this difference : I shall never be heard of again . The way to get up that mud is to drive in stakes to climb by . ” There were many branches ready to hand . He tore a stake and thrust it into the mud . It sank in for three feet as easily as if the mud were something softer than butter . With a sobbing noise , followed by a gurgle , some reddish water , rapidly turning to something black , iridescent and semi - solid , exuded from about it . Sard drove in a second stake above it , with a third above that : at each thrust the bank quaked and water or liquid mud exuded : there was also an ominous sag in the body of the bank . “ Neck or nothing , ” Sard said . He drove in a fourth stake and instantly swung himself up on to the gabion or fan of the roots by which he held . He was only just in time . The fourth stake broke the last strength of the barrier : it gave outwards : a shoot of water spurted it outwards : a swirl of running mud followed the shoot : then it all came down with a crash , which picked up Sard 's tree , canted it out to mid - gully , and dashed it against a dam of other trees , on to which Sard was pitched . He picked himself up and slipped along a tree bole to a hand - hold by which he swung himself up to safety , just as the dam gave way . He was back almost at his starting - point , wet to the skin , mud to the thigh , bitten , sucked and foiled . The long pent - up seepings of the rains poured down from the burst bank before him . “ I 'm well out of that , ” he thought , “ but I 'm going to cross this gully ; for it is the short way and I still have time . ” He trotted up the gully for a few yards , wondering at the increase in the darkness since he stood there before .

Nevertheless , eager as was each of the household to have speculation satisfied and the future with whatever it might contain unfold , there was a simultaneous start of apprehension when the Galbraiths ' familiar red car stopped at the gate of the cottage . From it alighted neither Mr. Snelling nor any member of the family , but instead the chauffeur gravely delivered to Robert Morton a hastily scrawled note written in Mr. Galbraith 's spreading hand . Marveling a little that it was he to whom the communication should be addressed , the young man broke the seal of the letter . Madam Lee , he read , weary with excitement , had retired almost immediately after their departure , the maid attending her having left her sleeping like a tired child ; but when they had gone to arouse her in the morning , it had been only to find that she had passed quietly away in her sleep without struggle or suffering . Snelling had gone over to New York to make the necessary funeral arrangements , and the family were to follow the next day . There was nothing Bob could do , but if he and Delight wished to accompany them , Mrs. Galbraith would be glad to have them .

Nodding his head approvingly : “ Your notion 's really not such a bad one , my little girl , ” he said ; “ only , what 's to become of you ? ” Nini , encouraged by the way the interview was shaping , had dropped nonchalantly into the one and only armchair the room contained . Now , with eyes fixed on the ceiling , the girl sat in a day - dream , a prophetic dream . “ I have a sort of a notion , ” she murmured , “ that with all these new complications , Paulet is going to get cotched .

church , he stopped . I saw him study the granite building with the ivy climbing over the stones . Then to my surprise he said : “ What do you say if we pay the minister a visit ? ” He did not wait for me to make any reply , but started up the winding gravel path which led to the rectory . I followed rather puzzled at his sudden desire to call upon the clergyman . Ministers , as a rule , were very much out of his line , and as we waited at the rectory steps , I could not but wonder why he wished to see him . The door was at length opened by a woman . She was a very old lady and extremely deaf . I judged by her appearance that she must be the person who looked after the house , for Carter had told us that he was unmarried . To Bartley 's inquiry if the minister was in , she said he was not . I expected Bartley would then turn to go , but instead he suggested that we might wait in the study . She led us into a rather ill - kept room . There were a great many books in the bookcases along the wall , but they were dusty . In fact , the whole room could have been much cleaner . The desk was covered with newspapers , books and pamphlets . Even the chairs were dusty . It needed but a look at the room to understand the housekeeper did not believe that cleanliness was next to Godliness . The woman excused herself and went out leaving us alone . For a moment Bartley 's eyes went over the row of books , and then he went closer to examine them . From their appearance most of them had not been taken from their places in many days . The dust lay thick upon the dingy volumes — volumes which seemed to be mostly theological works , and of a very orthodox character . Of novels and works of science there was not a trace . All the books along the wall dealt with theology . I watched Bartley pull one of the volumes from the shelf and turn the pages . As his eyes fell upon some sentence , he gave a shrug of his shoulders and replaced the book . Walking over to the desk , he stood for a moment glancing at the disordered contents . Then he went over to the window and looked out . When he turned , his eyes searched the room as if looking for something , and at length came to rest on a bookcase which was near the door .

had come on her during one of the spells . ” “ Did she use the word ‘ spells ' ? ” Dr. Lytton asked . “ I think she did , ” De Medici answered . The two men became silent . The candles had burned down . One of them sputtered excitedly for a moment and then faded out . De Medici 's eyes watched the growing flicker of the three lights . Darkness would come .... His heart chilled . Florence , crazed and standing dagger in hand before her father .... Victor Ballau staring aghast at the horrible - eyed woman who wore the body of his daughter but in whose soul leaped the awful desires of a demoniacal stranger ... the lady of the dagger . “ Nothing is explained , ” he mused as the second candle drifted away . The darkness stepped closer to the two men . “ The beard ... the thing he clutched .... ” “ I follow your thoughts , ” murmured Dr. Lytton from behind his hand . “ The false Vandyke .... ” “ Yes , ” De Medici said . The two remaining candles were dying . A terror swept him . Darkness ... it would grow black . There were candles in the table drawer . His hands crept slowly forward and stopped . An inanition held them . He sat riveted , unable to stir . Terror exploded a Roman candle in his head .... “ Ah , ” he breathed , a sweat covering him . Darkness ! A black room . His throat framed a cry .... “ Ah , ” he moaned . Hands were pressing him down , holding him against the chair . Something was at his throat . No , inside his throat , crawling into his mouth . Suddenly his arms flung themselves against the air . He plunged to his feet , beating at the blackness . “ Lights ... lights ! ” came in a scream from his throat . The doctor 's voice roared a command . “ Stand still ! ” The figure of De Medici spun crazily in the darkness and crashed into the velvet - covered wall . It sank without sound to the floor . The doctor groped toward the table . “ Julien ! ” he cried . His thick fingers were fumbling with a match box . He held a quickly lighted candle aloft . The curtained room swayed and danced in the shadows .... A figure lay , face down , arms outstretched and fingers spread against the gigantic - seeming drape . The telephone was ringing . Its bell tinkled eerily in the dark . Dr. Lytton stood listening . A voice was waiting for him . He stepped forward and lifted the receiver from its hook . “ Is this Mr. De Medici ? ” a voice asked . “ Yes , ” the doctor	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... 
the week , there being no actor available at the price they could pay for a mid - season employment . And so mother finally agreed . Bandoux played in the cast that night . Oh , he was a scoundrel ! Everything that has happened , all the tragedy that haunted poor Victor Ballau 's life , came from him and his rottenness . The play that night was Sardou 's ‘ Tosca . ' “ Father has told me all these details . I was about three years old at the time . But I seem to remember the creature , a flamboyant type of cheap actor . With a grand manner and a nasty temper . Terribly vain of his looks . An unscrupulous rogue who devoted himself to boasting and to women . “ Anyway , Bandoux took the part of Baron Scarpia . Mother played Floria La Tosca . It had always been one of her favorite rôles . The play went through the first act with nothing unusual happening . Mother was nervous and excited but managed to restrain herself . Her loathing of this man Bandoux was almost too much for her . And in the second act the thing happened . The grief he had caused her , the hatred his perfidy had left in her heart , flamed out . And when the murder scene arrived , poor mother went out of her head . She raised the dagger to kill Baron Scarpia as she had so often done in other performances . But this time she screamed and hurled herself at Bandoux . He was almost taken by surprise but managed to defend himself and escaped with a slight wound . Mother fainted . There was pandemonium and the curtain was rung down . “ Father came back the next morning and found her still raving . She had been taken to a hospital and was completely out of her mind . She was Floria La Tosca , screaming the idiotic lines of the play and going through the pantomime of the stage murder . For a month she lay completely insane . Her mildest moments were spent in weeping . The rest of the time she lay crying out that she wanted to kill Scarpia , who had betrayed her . Poor father was beside himself with grief . Nothing , of course , could be done with Bandoux . They got rid of him and hushed up the scandal . The theater was closed and father devoted himself to her . He was a wonderful man , the finest man that ever lived . ” She paused in her story , her eyes glistening with tears . “ An impression I always had , ” whispered De Medici , “ a man smiling courteously at grief . ” “ He did his best , ” Florence continued . “ And gradually the active mania left her .

heaven , had not the dubious looks of the unpleasant old man driven all celestial ideas clean out of his head . “ That 'll do me , ” was as much as he had cared to say . Thereupon the worthy M. Moche had proceeded to put a number of leading questions . What could Fandor do ? Write ? Yes ? ... Good . That was capital . He could draw , too ? then he could draw signatures ? in fact , copy signatures , eh ? copy them , you know , eh ? Yes , again ? Better and better ... The old man seemed delighted . Fandor had judicially sized up his new employer by this time ; yes , there was no doubt he could be of great service to him on occasions . Then M. Moche had asked the young man to tell him precisely who and what he was . But on that point , Fandor had proved reticent to the last degree . “ I 've got pals , ” this was all he would say , “ who have nicknamed me ‘ Little Tremendous , ' because I 'm pretty nimble with my maulies and ai n't afraid to use 'em . ” The information was vague enough . But Moche was not the man to insist on any excessive precision of statement . He felt little doubt his new clerk must have had a somewhat chequered past . If it did n't suit him to let out exactly who he was , well , that was his business ... And that was why Moche , after informing Fandor that he would be where clients were concerned the “ Chief of Staff ” in his office , addressed the young man familiarly by the name he had chosen to give himself . “ Look here , young Handy Man , I 'm going to send you on an errand . ” “ Very good , M'sieu Moche . ” “ An errand to a pretty girl 's .... ” “ Better still , M'sieu Moche . ” “ But no nonsense , you know ! it 's a serious matter , and you must be serious .

"the early autumn breeze that now and again gently ruffled the waters of the ocean . A thousand stars danced lightly in the sky and were reflected in the undulating waves below . And in the moonlit path over the waters hovered an aerocab gleaming silvery white in the radiance . The cab was far from New York , away from the beaten traffic . Occasionally other aircraft came into view but always at a distance . To Alice and Ralph this solitude was Paradise . Night after night they hired an aerocab and flew to this lonely airway , where seated side by side , with only the driver for a chaperon , they were absolutely happy . The driver was a silent man who , as long as he was well paid for his time , was content to describe endless circles indefinitely . On this particular evening Alice seemed , to Ralph , more lovely than he had ever before seen her . In the caressing light of the mellow moon her flowerlike face glowed with a new radiance , and her dark eyes , shadowed with long curling lashes , were mistily tender . Between these two there was no need for words . So perfectly were their thoughts attuned that each knew what the other felt . And so , presently , their hands stole out and met , and clasped . And it seemed to both that Heaven could hold no greater happiness than this , until , with one accord , they turned their faces to each other , and their lips met . To them nothing existed beyond themselves and their love . The voice of another aerocab driver hailing them made them realize that there were still ties that bound them to Earth , and they moved apart a little self - consciously , as a cab drew alongside their own . """""""" Having some trouble with my motor , """""""" called the newcomer . """""""" Could you let me have a few copper connectors to repair the damage ? """""""" """""""" Sure , """""""" returned their driver , and the two cabs came together and were made fast . Ralph , seeing that his man could attend to the matter , turned away from them towards Alice , and again drew her hand into his own , where it snuggled confidingly . Quite suddenly he was aware of a sickish , sweet odor , which almost instantly became suffocating . He was conscious of the pressure of Alice 's fingers and then blackness overwhelmed him . 11 THE FLIGHT INTO SPACE How long he was unconscious Ralph did not know , but when he came to his senses the moon had sunk low on the horizon . He felt unbearably weary and his limbs seemed too heavy to move . For a time he half lay in his seat looking stupidly down at the ocean , his mind a blank"	""""""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""""""" """""""""" """""""""" """""""""""" """""""""" """""""""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""" """""""""" """""""" """""""

Blueneck said nothing but took his garments and began to put them on . “ Methinks your captain , the Spanish Dick , has set eyes on a pretty wench , ” she said slowly .

"Deirdre had wrestled with death for possession of him . Her eyes still bore the shadow of the conflict . Davey was wan and vanquished . He knew that she had wrested his spirit from the darkness on which it had been drifting , and the knowledge made a serene joyousness in him . Speech deserted them ; they had no voices to talk with . Just this gazing of eyes on eyes told all that there was to tell . Later on she went from his side and began to move about the hut , gathering the brushwood into the hearth , raking over the ashes and making the fire again . His eyes followed her . The hut was shabby and disorderly by daylight . Conal had used it when he was mustering , and there was a heap of rusty irons in the corner , a few hoarded tins and half - empty jars of grease on the shelves , some old clothes , worn - out boots and green - hide thongs behind the door . The bunk , with its sheepskins , and a table made of a rough hewn plank on three poles set in the floor , were the only furniture .

God in heaven ... we 're expected to ... ” Moche left his sentence unfinished , broke off his peroration in mid career , for it had become entirely unnecessary . Peeping through his parted fingers , the old rascal had not missed a single one of Ascott 's movements . Now the latter , leaving the old man to finish out his litany of lamentations by himself , had suddenly quitted the room , banging the door behind him . This was just what Moche was hoping for ; he calculated that the Englishman , seeing nothing could be made of the uncle , was going to try and catch up the niece before she had left the house . Treading softly , he crept to the door giving on the landing outside , the same Ascott had shut a moment or two before , and set it ajar . There he stood listening , his face beaming , and rubbing his hands . Ascott , who had caught sight of Nini Guinon on the floor below as he was going downstairs , was leaning over the bannister and calling in a voice shaking with excitement : “ Mademoiselle ! pst ! Mademoiselle , I say ! Mademoiselle Eugénie ! Listen ! ” Then it was Nini 's clear , flute - like voice , pitched in a tone of perfect innocence , that answered : “ Who 's calling me ? Is it you , dear uncle ? ” Ascott , lowering his voice , and now flying three steps at a time down the stairs to join the girl below , went on : “ Why , no , mademoiselle , so to speak , it 's not just exactly your uncle , but it 's I , his friend , the gentleman who was in his office just now . Listen , I 've something to tell you ; will you let me walk with you ? ” Then the two voices mingled in an indistinct murmur , and the pair could be heard leaving the house . Moche went back into his rooms with every sign of profound satisfaction , skipping about clumsily like a dancing bear in a merry mood . “ Taken ! the bait 's taken fine ! ” he chuckled , “ not a doubt of it , here 's another stroke of genius to good old Père Moche 's credit ! ” CHAPTER XIII THE WALL THAT BLED Elisabeth Dollon was busily engaged installing her belongings in the new flat in the Rue de l'Evangile , into which she had moved the previous evening .

it . Must have left it . ” In the years that followed she learned what the absence of the malacca stick meant . It had come to be a symbol in every pawnshop on Clark Street . Its appearance was bond for a sum a hundred times its actual value . Gaylord Ravenal always paid his debts . She finished undressing , in silence . Her face was red and swollen . She looked young and helpless and almost ugly . He was uncomfortable and self - reproachful . “ I 'm sorry , Nola . I was detained . We 'll go to the theatre to - morrow night . ” She almost hated him then . Being , after all , a normal woman , there followed a normal scene — tears , reproaches , accusations , threats , pleadings , forgiveness . Then : “ Uh — Nola , will you let me take your ring — just for a day or two ? ” “ Ring ? ” But she knew . “ You 'll have it back . This is Wednesday . You 'll have it by Saturday . I swear it . ” The clear white diamond had begun its travels with the malacca stick . He had spoken the truth when he said that he had been unavoidably detained . She had meant not to sleep . She had felt sure that she would not sleep . But she was young and healthy and exhausted from emotion . She slept . As she lay there by his side she thought , before she slept , that life was very terrible — but fascinating . Even got from this a glow of discovery . She felt old and experienced and married and tragic . She thought of her mother . She was much , much older and more married , she decided , than her mother ever had been . They returned to Thebes in February . Magnolia longed to be near her father . She even felt a pang of loneliness for her mother . The little white cottage near the river , at Thebes , looked like a toy house . Her bedroom was doll - size . The town was a miniature village , like a child 's Christmas set . Her mother 's bonnet was a bit of grotesquerie . Her father 's face was etched with lines that she did not remember having seen there when she left . The home - cooked food , prepared by Parthy 's expert hands , was delicious beyond belief . She was a traveller returned from a far place . Captain Andy had ordered a new boat . He talked of nothing else . The old _ Cotton Blossom _ , bought from Pegram years before , was to be discarded . The new boat was to be lighted by some newfangled gas arrangement instead of the old kerosene lamps .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
sent word there . ” “ By whom ? ” “ Find out . ” At this point , which might have been troublous but for intervention , the Scandinavian interfered . He was a sinister - looking man with a swollen lower lip which drooped . This gave him permanently the look of a gargoyle . He looked , on the whole , like a young devil just after his first night in hell , a little bloated and battered , but thrilled by the way Beelzebub wore his bowler . He came forward towards the officer . “ Mr. O'Prien , ” he said , “ dis feller he wass one got - tam police - spy . What he want de police for ? What he come putt in for ? He call hisself mate of de _ Pathfinder _ , by Chesus . Py Chesus , I do n't pelieve one got - tam wort he say , py Chesus . And this got - tam yarn about a got - tam sting - ray . You see , fellers , he iss a spy . Dat 's what dis feller is : a spy . He tell de police and get us pinched . ” The black - eyed smiling sloucher slouched forward as the Scandinavian warmed to his appeal . His left hand shot out suddenly , caught him on the chest and slung him violently backward . The motion seemed effortless , but the strength used must have been that of a bull , for the Scandinavian went backwards tottering for five steps and then sat down . The other men laughed . The sloucher grinned at the Scandinavian . “ Come off with your folly , ” he said . “ Tell it to the marines but not to the deck department . ” The Scandinavian rose up whimpering and rubbing the sore place . “ Py Chesus , Doug , ” he said , “ if you wass not trunk , I make you pay for dat . It 's your being trunk saves you , py Chesus . ” “ Well , I am drunk , ” Douglas said , “ I thank God I am drunk . I like being drunk : it 's so cadoodle .

had made straight for Chicago , at that period the gamblers ' paradise . When Ravenal announced this step , a little look of panic had come into Magnolia 's eyes . She was reluctant to demur at his plans . It was the thing her mother always had done when her father had proposed a new move . Always Captain Andy 's enthusiasm had suffered the cold douche of Parthy 's disapproval . At the prospect of Chicago , the old haunts , congenial companions , the restaurants , the theatres , the races , Ravenal had been more elated than she had ever seen him . He had become almost loquacious . He could even be charming to Mrs. Hawks , now that he was so nearly free of her . That iron woman had regarded him as her enemy to the last and , in making over to Magnolia the goodish sum of money which was due her , had uttered dire predictions , all of which promptly came true . That first year in Chicago was a picture so kaleidoscopic , so extravagant , so ridiculous that even the child Kim retained in her memory 's eye something of its colour and pageantry . This father and mother in their twenties seemed really little older than their child . Certainly there was something pathetically childish in their evident belief that they could at once spend their money and keep it intact . Just a fur coat — what was that ! Bonnets . A smart high yellow trap . Horses . The races . Suppers . A nursemaid for Kim . Magnolia knew nothing of money . She never had had any . On the _ Cotton Blossom _ money was a commodity of which one had little need . On coming to Chicago they had gone directly to the Sherman House . Compared with this , that first visit to Chicago before Kim 's birth had been a mere picnic jaunt . Ravenal was proud of his young wife and of his quiet , grave big - eyed child ; of the nursemaid in a smart uniform ; of the pair of English hackneys which he sometimes allowed Magnolia to drive , to her exquisite delight . Magnolia had her first real evening dress , cut décolleté ; tasted champagne ; went to the races at the Washington Park race track ; sat in a box at Hooley 's ; was horrified at witnessing the hootchie - kootchie dance on the Midway Plaisance at the World 's Fair . The first fur coat was worthy of note . The wives of the well - to - do wore sealskin sacques as proof of their husband 's prosperity . Magnolia descended to these later . But the pelts which warmed her during that first winter of Chicago lake blasts and numbing cold had been cunningly matched in Paris , and French fingers had fashioned them into	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .

I suppose it 's my duty to stay , even if I die of consumption , being shut up without any fresh air . ” He would play the martyr ; which was not so hard , for he was one , and looked like one , with his thin , one - sided little figure , and his shabby clothes . Both Sadie and Jennie gazed at him with admiration , and sighed with relief . But later on , Peter thought of an idea . He could go out at night , he told Sadie , and slip out the back way , so that no one would see him ; he would not go into crowds or brightly lighted streets , so there would be no chance of his being recognized . There was a fellow he absolutely had to see , who owed him some money ; it was way over on the other side of the city -- that was why he rejected Jennie 's offer to accompany him . So that evening Peter climbed a back fence and stole thru a neighbor 's chicken - yard and got away . He had a fine time ducking and dodging in the crowds , making sure that no one was trailing him to his secret rendezvous -- no “ Red ” who might chance to be suspicious of his “ comradeship . ” It was in the “ American House , ” an obscure hotel , and Peter was to take the elevator to the fourth floor , without speaking to any one , and to tap three times on the door of Room 427 . Peter did so , and the door opened , and he slipped in , and there he met Jerry McGivney , with the face of a rat . “ Well , what have you got ? ” demanded McGivney ; and Peter sat down and started to tell . With eager fingers he undid the amateur sewing in the lining of his coat , and pulled out his notes with the names and descriptions of people who had come to see him . McGivney glanced over them quickly . “ Jesus ! ” he said , “ What 's the good of all this ? ” “ Well , but they 're Reds ! ” exclaimed Peter . “ I know , ” said the other , “ but what of that ? We can go hear them spout at meetings any night . We got membership lists of these different organizations . But what about the Goober case ? ” “ Well , ” said Peter , “ they 're agitating about it all the time ; they 've been printing stuff about me . ” “ Sure , we know that , ” said McGivney . “ And the hell of a fine story you gave them ; you must have enjoyed hearing yourself talk . But what	, ” he sighed , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” , ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” 
, that hero . “ Sir , ” she made answer , “ you speak strangely . So you believe in love ? ” “ I do , madam , ” replied the American , “ and the more profoundly , and it may be the more sadly , as this very evening I have been a witness of the birth of two sentiments , one a half indifferent attraction , the other a genuine passion . ” “ What reason for sadness in that , sir ? ” “ Every reason , for I am much afraid that these two sentiments will end in sadness and disillusionment . ” For a moment the princess sat silent , puzzled , hesitating . At last she spoke with an affectation of haughtiness such as every woman knows how to assume : “ I do not understand you very well , sir . You speak in riddles . I am a Russian , you an American . I beg you use some other dialect than Parisian ‘ blague ' ; be more explicit . ” With a quick glance , Tom Bob made sure there was no listener to pay heed to his talk with the fascinating princess . The Neapolitan singers had been succeeded by a bevy of quaint step - dancers , whom all the company was attentively watching . Reassured on this point , Tom Bob , intoxicated perhaps by the beauty of the night , perhaps crazed by Sonia Danidoff 's loveliness , charmed no doubt by the sympathy she had never ceased to lavish on him throughout this after - dinner talk , resolved to burn his boats : “ You do not understand , madam , ” he resumed , “ you surprise me ! I imagine you have not failed to notice the marked attentions , to say no more , paid you by our common friend , M. Ascott ? Oh ! never deny it , madam ! To - night , as indeed he does habitually , M. Ascott has made the most determined efforts to win your favour . ” There was almost a touch of mockery in the words , and Sonia Danidoff was too quick - witted not to catch the other 's drift . “ It would seem , ” she said , “ these efforts do not strike you , sir , as having been crowned with success ! you think my conquest is not an accomplished fact yet ? ” “ I do not think , madam ... _ I hope _ . ” And with these two little words which meant so much , which were equivalent to the most formal of declarations , Tom Bob , like a well - advised suitor , aware that a man must never demand an answer but always wait till it is offered , made his bow to the princess and walked away . “ I am going to	“ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

She had seen Mrs. Ross and Jessie go by to the Port in Cameron 's double - seated buggy . She thought they would ride together to the hills in that , Davey and her father . If they knew , they would stop at the Black Bull ; if no one had told them they would go on , she had decided . They would wonder why she was not on the wharf when the boat got in , to meet them . But McNab would not have that . He would not lose sight of her . Besides she did not want to meet the eyes of the men and women who would be there , and hear what they had to say . She was cut off from the world as she stood at the window of McNab 's house . Her mind was too utterly weary to reason further . As she watched and waited a sense of bleak desolation closed in on her . Her eyes ached for sight of the Schoolmaster 's form against the clear sky , although she knew she would hardly see it above the buggy and among other people . She asked herself what he would do when he found that she was not waiting for him at Steve's -- what he would think when he found the letter that was lying for him there . Steve would have to read it for him . It would break his heart , the letter that she had wept and prayed over ; but it was better that his heart should break than that he should go to the Island again .

It was absurd , he told himself , he , Black'erchief Dick , smuggler , chief of all the Eastern coast , Captain of the _ Coldlight _ , and owner of six other good sailing - vessels in the trade , to waste his time humming tunes after a serving - wench , a pretty lass of some seventeen years , who served rum to a pack of greasy fishermen in a wayside tavern on the almost uninhabited end of a mud island , when there were women in France , in Spain -- he shrugged his shoulders , and to take his thoughts off the girl he ran his mind over the events of the preceding night . “ Friend , ” he said suddenly , wiping his lips with a dainty handkerchief , “ that same woman who so vilely returned my alms yesternight , what say'st thou is her name ? ” Big French sat up and yawned . “ Oh ! ” he said , “ that was Nan Swayle . ” At the sound of his voice Anny , who had been attending to the fire on the other side of the room , came forward and stood at the end of the table , looking at the pair with wide - open , serious eyes . “ Nan Swayle , ” the Spaniard rolled the name round his tongue thoughtfully . “ Ah , didst say she had been ducked as a witch ? ” Big French laughed . “ Ay , ” he said , “ at the Restoration of the King , and a mirthful figure she made , Captain , her thumbs and great toes tied crossways -- so , ” and he chuckled at the thought of it . Anny leant forward , her face flushed and her eyes bright . “ A cruel jest , Master French , to so ill - treat a poor woman as far from being a witch as you an angel . ” Black'erchief Dick regarded her excited little form and earnest eyes with open admiration . “ Marry , Mistress , ” he said , “ what a friend thou art to Mother Swayle !

assume an aspect that made my very soul turn sick and cold . Rhodes , however , divining perhaps what was in my mind , pointed out that we had not been lost very long ! and that surely we would find water some place . A man , said he , in the equable temperature of this subterranean world , could live for quite a time without water . I have no doubt that a man could -- if he were lying in bed . But we were not doing that ; we were in constant motion . The arduous exercise that we were undergoing , our fatigue , the anxieties and fears that preyed upon the mind -- each was contributing its quota to the dire and steady work of enervation . No , I would fight against despair ; but certainly I could imbibe no consolation , no strength , either mental or physical , from a deliberate blinking of facts . And one of the facts was that , unless we soon found water , ours would be that fate which has overtaken so many of those who have gone forth to search out the secrets of mysterious places . During that halt for lunch -- and what an awful lunch that was -- Milton brought forward his journal , and Drorathusa , by means of pictures drawn in the book , made it clear to us that they would never have missed the route had it not been for the loss of their beloved demon . That , of course , made Rhodes and me very sorry ; but , if the demon had not been killed , we certainly should have been even more sorry -- and , I 'm afraid , in a worse place than this in which we now found ourselves . This strange intelligence , too , reminded me of grandfather Scranton 's wonder as to how _ his _ angel and her demon had journeyed over rock , snowfield and glacier to the Tamahnowis Rocks through that dense , blinding vapor . I understood that now ; they were guided by the wonderful instinct of the ape - bat . How truly wonderful that instinct is , we were yet to learn . Little wonder that Drorathusa mourned the loss of her dear , beloved , her hideous demon ! The bat has in all ages been the personification of repulsiveness , gloom and horror ; and yet it is in many ways a very wonderful creature . For instance , it can fly through intricate passages with ease and certitude _ when blinded _ , avoiding any obstacle in or across its way as though in possession of perfect vision . No marvel , therefore , that some scientists have declared that the bat must possess a sixth sense . The accepted explanation , however , is that the creature discovers the objects , in the words of	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
and I heard him breathe loudly and slowly , and as though it somewhat hurt him , and I -- oh , Mother -- I heard him call me : ‘ Anny , Anny , Anny , ' he said as though he was speaking from a long way off ; then he laid his head on his arms there on the counting - table and I heard him breathing again , loud and fast . ” Her voice died away and there was no sound in the coolness of the little hut ; then she began to cry again . Suddenly Nan spoke , and her voice sounded sharp after Anny 's impassioned murmuring . “ And you were married to the Spanish captain ? ” she asked . Anny sat up , her beautiful green eyes brimming with tears . “ Yes , ” she said pitifully , “ and I love him . ” “ Who ? Black'erchief Dick ? ” “ Nay , oh , nay , Mother ; nay , Hal , Hal Grame -- my love ! ” A sob rose in her throat but she swallowed it down and continued almost eagerly , “ And as he sat there , and I watching , I knew ' twas he I loved , for all his foolings , and I wondered would I creep behind and put my arms about his neck , and put my face to his hair , but I minded I was married to the Spaniard , and I knew I could not we d with Hal , and I wondered what would I do , and then , as I was watching him , he looked up and saw me . His face was very pale , and I have never seen any one but the dead so pale . I thought he would have cried out , for his mouth opened and his lips moved , but he said naught ; then he stood up and came toward me , slowly , as though I had been a spirit , and his eyes were so dark and full of something , I know not what -- that I put up my hands to hide my face . ” She broke off abruptly and looked round her , and brushed the hair off her forehead before she spoke again -- all the time Nan rocked silently to and fro . “ Then I heard him speaking below his breath , and his voice hurt me , Nan ; his voice hurt me . ‘ Anny , ' he said , ‘ Anny , are you come back to me , my love ?

, in that Lake Michigan region . Magnolia shivered a little and drew about her the little absurd flounced shoulder cape so recently purchased . The crowd on the veranda had caught the last tune and were strumming it now on their banjos and mandolins . The kindly light behind them threw their foolish faces into shadow . You heard their voices , plaintive , even sweet : the raucous note fled for the moment . Fifi 's voice and Jerry 's ; Gerty 's voice and little Billee 's . I got a wings . You got a wings . All God 's chillun got a wings . When I get to heab'n I 'm goin' to put on my wings , I 'm goin' to fly . . . Magnolia turned to wave to them as the chestnuts made the final curve in the driveway and stretched eagerly toward home . Silence between the two for a long half hour . Then Ravenal , almost humbly : “ Well — I suppose I 'm in for it , Nola . Shoot ! ” But she had been thinking , “ I must take things in hand now . I have been like a foolish young girl when I 'm really quite an old married woman . I suppose being bossed by Mama so much did that . I must take Kim in hand now . What a fool I 've been . ‘ Do n't be silly , darling . ' He was right . I have been — — ” Aloud she said , only half conscious that he had spoken , “ What did you say ? ” “ You know very well what I said . I suppose I 'm in for one of your mother 's curtain lectures . Go on . Shoot and get it over . ” “ Do n't be silly , darling , ” said Magnolia , a trifle maliciously . “ What a lovely starlight night it is ! . . . ” She laughed a little . “ Do you know , those dough - faced Fifis and Tantines and Mignons were just like the Ohio and Illinois farm girls , dressed up . The ignorant girls who used to come to see the show . I 'll bet that when they were on the farm , barefooted , poor things , they were Annie and Jenny and Tillie and Emma right enough . ” XVI “ And this , ” said Sister Cecilia , “ is the chapel . ” She took still another key from the great bunch on her key chain and unlocked the big gloomy double doors . It was incredible that doors and floors and wainscotings so shining with varnish could still diffuse such an atmosphere of gloom . She entered ahead of them with the air of a cicerone . It seemed to Magnolia that the corridors were tunnels of murk .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Chamber of Commerce , and the owner of this hall would be called up and warned by the president of the bank which held a mortgage on the hall , or by the chairman of the board of directors of the Philharmonic Orchestra which gave concerts there . So there was no Red mass meeting that night -- and none for many a night thereafter in American City ! Guffey 's office had got its German spy story ready , and next morning , here was the entire front page of the American City “ Times ” given up to the amazing revelation that Karl von Stroeme , agent of the German government , and reputed to be a nephew of the German Vice - chancellor , had been arrested in American City , posing as a Swedish sewing - machine agent , but in reality having been occupied in financing the planting of dynamite bombs in the buildings of the Pioneer Foundry Company , now being equipped for the manufacture of machine - guns . Three of von Stroeme 's confederates had been nabbed at the same time , and a mass of papers full of important revelations -- not the least important among them being the fact that only yesterday von Stroeme had been caught dealing with a German Socialist of the ultra - Red variety , an official of the Bread and Cake - Makers ' Union Number 479 , by the name of Ernst Apfel . The government had a dictagraph record of conversations in which von Stroeme had contributed one hundred dollars to the Liberty Defense League , an organization which the Reds had got up for the purpose of carrying on agitation for the release of the I. W. W.s arrested in the dynamite plot against the life of Nelse Ackerman . Moreover it was proven that Apfel had taken this money and distributed it among several German Reds , who had turned it in to the defense fund , or used it in paying for circulars calling for a general strike . Peter 's heart was leaping with excitement ; and it leaped even faster when he had got his breakfast and was walking down Main Street . He saw crowds gathered , and American flags flying from all the buildings , just as on the day of the Preparedness parade . It caused Peter to feet queer spasms of fright ; he imagined another bomb , but he could n't resist the crowds with their eager faces and contagious enthusiasm . Presently here came a band , with magnificent martial music , and here came soldiers marching -- tramp , tramp , tramp -- line after line of khaki - clad boys with heavy packs upon their backs and shiny new rifles . Our boys ! Our boys ! God bless them ! It was three regiments of the 223rd Division , coming from Camp Lincoln to be entrained for the war	Apfel sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er , esa - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
humble part in the great adventure . When he read that the biggest captains of industry and finance were selling their services to the government for the sum of one dollar a year , how could he complain , who was getting twenty dollars every week ? When some of the Reds in their meetings or in their “ literature ” declared that these captains of industry and finance were the heads of companies which were charging the government enormous prices and making anywhere from three to ten times the profits they had made before the war -- then Peter would know that he was listening to an extremely dangerous Bolshevik ; he would take the name of the man to McGivney , and McGivney would pull his secret wires , and the man would suddenly find himself out of a job -- or maybe being prosecuted by the health department of the city for having set out a garbage can without a cover . After persistent agitation , the radicals had succeeded in persuading a judge to let out McCormick and the rest of the conspirators on fifty thousand dollars bail apiece . That was most exasperating to Peter , because it was obvious that when you put a Red into jail , you made him a martyr to the rest of the Reds you made him conspicuous to the whole community , and then if you let him out again , his speaking and agitating were ten times as effective as before . Either you ought to keep an agitator in jail for good , or else you ought not put him in at all . But the judges did n't see that -- their heads were full of a lot of legal bunk , and they let David Andrews and the other Red lawyers hood - wink them . Herbert Ashton and his Socialist crowd also got out on bail , and the “ Clarion ” was still published and openly sold on the news - stands . While it did n't dare oppose the war any more , it printed every impolite thing it could possibly collect about the “ gigantic trading corporation ” known as the British Government , and also about the “ French bankers ” and the “ Italian imperialists . ” It clamored for democracy for Ireland and Egypt and India , and shamelessly defended the Bolsheviki , those pro - German conspirators and nationalizers of women . So Peter proceeded to collect more evidence against the “ Clarion ” staff , and against the I. W. Ws . Presently he read the good news that the government had arrested a couple of hundred of the I. W. W. leaders all over the country , and also the national leaders of the Socialists , and was going to try them all for conspiracy . Then came the trial of McCormick and Henderson and Gus and the rest ; and Peter picked up	Then he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was arrested , he was n , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was arrested , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was arrested , and he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't , he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't he was n't 't he was n't 't he was n't 't he was n't he was n't he was , he was n't he was , he was n't he was , he was n't 't he was , he was n't 't he was , he was n't 't he 't 't he 't he 't he 't he 't he 't he 't he 't he 't he 't 
thought traced itself sardonically over a single sentence . “ So this is Floria ! ” A desire to laugh came to him . The shock which her unexpected appearance beside Dr. Lytton had given him had been short - lived . At once , on top of his astonishment , had bloomed a new fear . At the sight of her and the triumphant - eyed scientist De Medici became aware in an instant that his carefully pieced - together theory of the thing lay in shreds . Unable to keep his thought calm and invent something plausible to explain the insane shiftings of the past few weeks , the terror from which he had suffered during the early days of the Ballau mystery reinstated itself . He sat now with his carefully molded smile , the smile that had aggravated the suspicions of Norton . “ The thing comes back , ” he mused . “ The creature in my bedroom , the creature that tried to murder me and that left a candle burning at my head and a crucifix on my chest , was not Florence . No , this creature was Julien De Medici . A crafty and insatiable maniac engaged in fooling himself . God , what a notion ! Yet if there is another self to me , how easy and natural . This becomes almost too ludicrous to be mania . But why not ? A heroic effort to establish an alibi in my own eyes . Rather clever , in a way . I see visions . I see the lady of the dagger . And I attack myself somewhat carefully but convincingly . And as a result I stand exonerated . It was not I who killed Ballau but this creature who tried the thing on me . Clever , yes . But twisted and absurd . But not if I am mad . That is , completely and intricately mad . Not if my sanity is a pose which I cunningly loan myself . But the letter from Rollo . Then I sent that to myself , too . Yet there was a postmark . Who saw the postmark ? I or the doctor ? I forget this point . ” The smile on De Medici 's long face weakened . His thin fingers moved dreamily over his cheek . In the silence of the cab his musings resumed : “ Then she knows it was I. And what she has done has been for my sake ... to protect me . There must be more to this than I have been able to remember . The night I called for her at the theater , the night it happened .... There must be innumerable things to remember . But I remember nothing . I ca n't begin to understand , and I want to laugh . Yes , my reasoning arouses laughter in me . If I laugh	Medici sat in a sardonically sardonically sardonically - mused , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically , sardonically .
much of a piece with the rest of his life experiences ; there had been hopes , and wonderful dreams , but very few realizations . Peter knew a lot about such matters ; in the orphan asylum there were few vicious practices which he did not witness , few obscene imaginings with which he was not made familiar . Also , Pericles Priam had been a man like the traditional sailor , with a girl in every port ; and generally in these towns and villages there had been no place for Peter to go save where Pericles went , so Peter had been the witness of many of his master 's amours and the recipient of his confidences . But none of these girls and women had paid any attention to Peter . Peter was only a “ kid ” ; and when he grew up and was no longer a kid , but a youth tormented with sharp desires , they still paid no attention to him -- why should they ? Peter was nothing ; he had no position , no money , no charms ; he was frail and undersized , his teeth were crooked , and one shoulder higher than the other . What could he expect from women and girls but laughter and rebuffs ? Then Peter moved on to the Temple of Jimjambo , and there a devastating experience befell him -- he tumbled head over heels and agonizingly in love . There was a chambermaid in the institution , a radiant creature from the Emerald Isles with hair like sunrise and cheeks like apples , and a laugh that shook the dish - pans on the kitchen walls . She laughed at Peter , she laughed at the major - domo , she laughed at all the men in the place who tried to catch her round the waist . Once or twice a month perhaps she would let them succeed , just to keep them interested , and to keep herself in practice . The only one she really favored was the laundry deliveryman , and Peter soon realized why . This laundry fellow had the use of an automobile on Sundays , and Nell would dress herself up to kill , and roll away in state with him . He would spend all his week 's earnings entertaining her at the beach ; Peter knew , because she would tell the whole establishment on Monday morning . “ Gee , but I had a swell time ! ” she would say ; and would count the ice - creams and the merry - go - rounds and the whirly - gigs and all the whang - doodle things . She would tell about the tattooed men and the five - legged calf and the woman who was half man , and all the while she would make the dishpans rattle . Yes , she was a marvelous creature ,	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Blossom _ troupe realized , at the end of two weeks , that Gaylord Ravenal was acting as director . It had come about naturally and inevitably . Ravenal had a definite theatre sense — a feeling for tempo , rhythm , line , grouping , inflection , characterization — any , or all , of these . The atmosphere had freshness for him ; he was interested ; he wished to impress Andy and Parthy and Magnolia ; he considered the whole business a gay adventure ; and an amusing interlude . For a month they played the bayous and plantations of Louisiana , leaving behind them a whole countryside whose planters , villagers , Negroes had been startled out of their Southern lethargy . These had known show boats and show - boat performances all their lives . They had been visited by this or that raffish , dingy , slap - dash , or decent and painstaking troupe . The _ Cotton Blossom _ company had the reputation for being the last - named variety , and always were patronized accordingly . The plays seldom varied . The performance was , usually , less than mediocre . They were , then , quite unprepared for the entertainment given them by the two handsome , passionate , and dramatic young people who now were cast as ingénue and juvenile lead of the Cotton Blossom Floating Palace Theatre company . Here was Gaylord Ravenal , fresh , young , personable , aristocratic , romantic of aspect . Here was Magnolia , slim , girlish , ardent , electric , lovely . Their make - believe adventures as they lived them on the stage became real ; their dangers and misfortunes set the natives to trembling ; their love - making was a fragrant and exquisite thing . News of this troupe seeped through from plantation to plantation , from bayou to bayou , from settlement to settlement , in some mysterious underground way . The _ Cotton Blossom _ did a record - breaking business in a region that had never been markedly profitable . Andy was jubilant , Parthy apprehensive , Magnolia starry - eyed , tremulous , glowing . Her lips seemed to take on a riper curve . Her skin was , somehow , softly radiant as though lighted by an inner glow , as Julie 's amber colouring , in the years gone by , had seemed to deepen into golden brilliance . Her eyes were enormous , luminous . The gangling , hobbledehoy , sallow girl of seventeen was a woman of eighteen , lovely , and in love . Back again in New Orleans there was a letter from Schultzy , a pathetic scrawl ; illiterate ; loyal . Elly was out of the hospital , but weak and helpless . He had a job , temporarily , whose nature he did not indicate .

"he had been struggling to get forward and was held back by mysterious , unknown forces , he realised that they were the lights of the shanty . The mare carried him on into the stable yard . The welcome yelp of dogs greeted his ears . He flung off her , staggered across the yard and burst open the back door . He was conscious of Farrel and Deirdre springing towards him , of Steve behind them . Then surging darkness , the swirling tides of dreamless darkness that had been pressing close to him all the way , closed over him . For a moment he struggled against them , trying to speak . A few muttered , incoherent words were all Deirdre and the Schoolmaster caught . He pitched forward . Deirdre ran to him . The Schoolmaster helped her to lift Davey over on his back . She moistened his lips with the spirit that Steve brought quickly . """""""" There 's blood on him , father , """""""" she cried . There was no tremor in her voice , only a tense anxiety .

fifty acres lying above William Lowrie 's plantation on the main branch of Old Town Creek . . . Magnolia stood erect . Indignation blazed in her fine eyes . “ But , Gaylord ! ” she said . “ Yes ! ” Certainly she had never before called him that . “ I mean this Gaylord . I mean the one who came after Samuel and Jean . Why isn't — why did n't — — ” “ Naughty boy , ” said Ravenal , with his charming smile . She actually yearned toward him then . He could not have said anything more calculated to bind his enchantment for her . They swayed toward each other over the top of the little glass - encased relic . Andy coughed hastily . They swayed gently apart . They were as though mesmerized . “ Folks out here in the churchyard ? ” inquired Andy , briskly , to break the spell . “ Ravenal kin ? ” “ Acres of 'em , ” Gaylord assured him , cheerfully . “ Son of . . . and daughter of . . . and beloved father of . . . . For that matter , there 's one just beside you . ” Andy side - stepped hastily , with a little exclamation . He cast a somewhat fearful glance at the spot toward which Ravenal so carelessly pointed . A neat gray stone slab set in the wall . Andy peered at the lettering it bore ; stooped a little . “ Here — you read it , Nollie . You 've got young eyes . ” Her fresh young cheek so near the cold gray slab , she read in her lovely flexible voice : Here lies the body of M^{rs } . Suzanne Ravenal , wife of Jean Baptista Ravenal Esq^{r } . , one of his Majesty 's Council and Surveyor General of the Lands of this Province , who departed this life Oct^{r } 19^{t } 1765 . Aged 37 Years . After labouring ten of them under the severest Bodily afflictions brought on by Change of Climate , and tho ' she went to her native land received no relief but returned and bore them with uncommon Resolution and Resignation to the last . Magnolia rose , slowly , from the petals of her flounced skirt spread about her as she had stooped to read . “ Poor darling ! ” Her eyes were soft with pity . Again the two seemed to sway a little toward each other , as though blown by a gust of passion . And this time little Captain Andy turned his back and clattered down the aisle . When they emerged again into the sunshine they found him , a pixie figure , leaning pensively against the great black trunk of a live oak . He was smoking a pipe somewhat apologetically , as though he hoped the recumbent	                                                         
his spacious hearth , and then after pulling once or twice at the short stem , he took out a bundle of letters from one of his capacious pockets and began to read them . They were from his son who held a fairly responsible place at the Court of His Gracious Majesty King Charles II , and from time to time a low wheezing chuckle broke from the old man 's lips and he coughed and spat , the tears of laughter starting to his eyes as he read . “ The sly devil , ” he muttered , laughing , “ bribed her serving - wench with a kiss , did he ? ” “ Oh ! dearie , dearie me -- Good King Jamie was more particular . What a thing it is to be young and to have a king to serve , ” and he laughed again , this time quite loudly . A female voice called shrilly from the room above : “ What 's ailing you , Francis ? ” Master Myddleton put the letters hastily into his pocket . “ ‘ Tis naught , Eliza , my foot doth trouble me somewhat . ” “ Marry , ” came the high , strident voice from the other room , “ ‘ tis strange that a gouty foot should make you laugh like a moon - struck lunatic . ” Master Myddleton made no reply , and after a moment 's pause the voice went on again : “ ‘ Tis a wonder you can laugh when we have a man coming to take the very bread out of our mouths . You should be praying the Lord to succour your wife and daughter , not laughing yourself daft by the fireside . ” The old man sighed and shook the ashes from his pipe and began slowly to refill it . “ What 's o'clock ? ” he called out after a minute or so 's silence . “ Half after eight ; he should be here by now if the river ai n't high over the bridle path at Tenpenny Heath . ” “ Ay , ” said Master Myddleton reflectively . There was the sound of a chair being pushed back and of heavy steps on the stairs , and Mistress Eliza Myddleton entered the dining room where her husband sat . She was a big fair woman who still preserved a remnant of the great beauty which had once been hers , but as she often told her neighbours when she was in a confidential mood , what with having a rapscallion stepson and a pretty daughter to look after , an excise man for a husband , and also being a staunch , God - fearing woman and a puritan at that , lines and wrinkles would come and they had -- as indeed any one might note for himself . Now as she came into the room	“ Oh , ” he muttered , “ Oh , ” he shook his head , “ Oh , ” he shook his head , “ Oh , ” he muttered , “ Oh , ” he shook his head , “ Oh , ” he shook his head , “ Oh , ” he muttered , “ Oh , ” he shook his head , “ ” he , “ ” , ” he said , “ ai , ” he said , “ ai , ” he said , “ ai , ” he said , “ ai , ” he said , “ ai , ” he said , “ ai , ” he said , “ ai , ai , ai ai , ai ai , ai ai , ai ai ai , ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai a

Once they twisted up to her and she read in them the clear expression of a pitiful uneasiness , the assurance of deathless fidelity , a prayer almost to go into the house .

two years ago — good eleven foot . ” Small wonder Magnolia was early impressed with this writhing monster that , with a single lash of its tail , could wipe a solid island from the face of the earth , or with a convulsion of its huge tawny body spew up a tract of land where only water had been . Mr. Pepper had respect for his river . “ Yessir , the Mississippi and this here Nile , over in Egypt , they 're a couple of old demons . I ai n't seen the Nile River , myself . Do n't expect to . This old river 's enough for one man to meet up with in his life . Like marrying . Get to learn one woman 's ways real good , you know about all there is to women and you got about all you can do one lifetime . ” Not at all the salty old graybeard pilot of fiction , this Mr. Pepper . A youth of twenty - four , nerveless , taciturn , gentle , profane , charming . His clear brown eyes , gazing unblinkingly out upon the river , had tiny golden flecks in them , as though something of the river itself had taken possession of him , and become part of him . Born fifty years later , he would have been the steel stuff of which aviation aces are made . Sometimes , in deep water , Mr. Pepper actually permitted Magnolia to turn the great pilot wheel that measured twice as high as she . He stood beside her , of course ; or her father , if he chanced to be present , stood behind her . It was thrilling , too , when her father took the wheel in an exciting place — where the water was very shoal , perhaps ; or where the steamer found a stiff current pushing behind her , and the tricky dusk coming on . At first it puzzled Magnolia that her father , omnipotent in all other parts of the _ Creole Belle _ , should defer to this stripling ; should actually be obliged , on his own steamer , to ask permission of the pilot to take the wheel . They were both beautifully formal and polite about it . “ What say to my taking her a little spell , Mr. Pepper ? ” “ Not at all , Captain Hawks . Not at all , sir , ” Mr. Pepper would reply , cordially if ambiguously . His gesture as he stepped aside and relinquished the wheel was that of one craftsman who recognizes and respects the ability of another . Andy Hawks had been a crack Mississippi River pilot in his day . And then to watch Captain Andy skinning the wheel — climbing it round and round , hands and feet , and looking for all the world like a	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

the doctor smiled . “ No . A few more things , ” Norton answered testily . “ They may interest you . The scene of the crime , eh ? The disorder and the mysterious props ? Well , the murder suddenly committed — committed during a moment of despair and passion — the young woman stood beside the body of the man she had killed and some sort of a notion of planting evidence to throw the police off the track came into her head . A notion typical of the woman who has spent her life in the theater . You 'll remember she was beside herself at this moment , that whatever she did in the half hour following the slaying of Ballau would naturally be the things an innocent and imaginative woman , and not a hardened criminal , would do in an effort to cover up the crime . She began to tear things and overthrow things . She went about it bewilderedly . Her idea was to make it seem as if a terrific struggle had taken place so that suspicion would not fall on a woman but on some powerful assailant . But you saw yourself how she bungled it in her distraction . The books , curtains , pictures : the crucifix and the candle — all unconvincing . The table idiotically set as for a supper for two . All things that a distracted , imaginative and hysterical young woman with a theatrical training would do . ” “ Excellent , ” breathed Dr. Lytton . “ Your psychology stands on firm ground . We might even go a step further . We might even say that a very clever murderer or murderess would have arranged that scene not to give the police false clews for a crime , but to make it seem as if Ballau had killed himself — and arranged the entire scene to convince the police a crime had not been committed . She might have figured out something of that nature , do n't you think ? ” “ Yes , I thought of that , ” Norton said slowly , “ but I doubt it . She had n't time . ” “ Unless , ” Dr. Lytton objected , “ unless the murder was committed as soon as she entered the room . Or , let us say , before .... ” Norton looked indignantly at the scientist . “ The theory does n't impress you despite the evidence ? ” he asked . “ I would be more impressed and certainly more interested , ” Dr. Lytton answered , “ if your theories included the presence of the false beard that was found in Ballau 's hand . ” Lieutenant Norton nodded and opened the drawer of his desk again .

. For a while I studied the view before me . A few yards away the green grass of the lawn ended at the waters of the lake . It was not a small lake , and I judged it must be several miles to the other shore . Far away I could see the mountains , their summits dark and cool against the blue sky . Under the slight breeze the waters of the lake lapped the shore with a gentle murmur , and the sound of the exhaust of a motor boat came faintly to my ears . Not only was it beautiful but also restful , and I gave a contended grin as I thought of the hot city I had left . Carter returned in a few moments with a tray — a tray which had three tall glasses in which ice tinkled with a pleasing sound . He was not alone , for with him was a tall man whom I judged must have been around forty - five — a man who carried himself with an air of distinction , and whose hair had begun to turn white . When they reached my side , Carter introduced him as his friend Ranville , the inspector from Scotland Yard . Ranville was not the usual blond Saxon , nor for that matter did his speech have much of an English accent . A glance at his well - knit frame and his brick - red face told that he spent much of his time in the open air . He took my hand with a firm clasp and expressed his regrets that Bartley had been unable to come with me . There was something very likable about the man , and there were the little lines around his lips which showed that he had a sense of humor . Sinking into our chairs , we slowly sipped our highballs , talking of this and that . The dog , glad at his release from the car , wandered about the yard , only to plunge at last into the waters of the lake . Then , as there came a long silence , Carter said : “ I will take you up to your room , Pelt . We are going out to dinner to - night . That is one reason I am sorry Bartley is not here . ” I turned an inquiring glance in his direction , and he gave a grin as he replied : “ You are going to meet a real highbrow for once , Pelt . We dine with Professor Henry Warren . You know this town is his birthplace . ” Though like every person who had read the newspapers during the last few months I knew of Henry Warren , I was rather surprised to hear we were to dine with him .

the second round began . The gong had scarcely stopped before Ben was in the Carib 's corner on a roving cruise . Like many men , he boxed better for having had his stage fright warmed out of him in the knock and hurry of a first round . He hit rather low still ; perhaps with his oblique and downcast eyes he could not do otherwise . He was clumsy but exceedingly strong . The Carib fought him off and made some play upon his face , but lightly as though the bout were a sparring match . Ben 's seconds shouted insults at him ; the negroes yelled to him to go in and finish the dirty white dog . He boxed on gracefully , grinning alike at insults and cheers : he was playing with Ben . He drove Ben into a corner and clouted him right and left , Ben kneed him hard in the ribs and drove himself out of the corner ; turning sharply , he fouled the Carib with both hands , kneed him in the ribs again and sent his right across as the Carib staggered . He was short with his blow ; the Carib slipped aside , recovered , rushed and sent Ben flying through the ropes , off the platform , into his seconds ' arms . The negroes rose and yelled and sang ; knives and revolvers came out on to the laps of the whites . The referee counted five very slowly while Ben climbed back into the ring . The Carib rushed : Ben stopped him : got into a clinch with him : refused to break : hung on to him : wore through the round with him hanging on his shoulder , while the negroes sank back into their seats with a moaning croon . Right at the end of the round the men broke : the Carib came in like a flash , Ben rallied to it , there was a hot exchange : then — Time . Instantly there came yells of protest at the foulness of Ben 's fighting , but the yells this time were from a few , because all saw that it had been the Carib 's round . The referee let the protests pass by , turning his back on the negroes and talking about something else in a loud tone on the other side of the ring . He abused a sweetmeat seller for bringing flies into the arena ; when he had finished with him he swaggered to the centre of the ring with a phrase:—“It is well known that I am for the sport , the sport English , the sport native , the sport antique , the sport all the time . I am not for the white , I am not for the coloured , I am for the sport : it is well known . Money speaks all languages ,	Ben swaggered into the ring and yelled : “I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib , I am a Carib .
he said . “ Why , what for -- art not tired , surely ? ” The girl shook her head . “ Nay , ” she said , “ but---- ” She stopped and looked at the hull again . Hal followed the direction of her eyes before he spoke again . Then he laughed . “ Why , Anny , you are afraid to pass your grandsire 's boat . ” Then , as she did not speak , he took her little chin in his brown hand and raised her face to his . “ What are you feared of when I am with you , sweetheart ? ” he asked . The girl shivered slightly . “ They say , ” she began hesitatingly , “ that Pet Salt is a witch . ” Hal 's face became grave . “ Ay , ” he said , “ they do say so , but , Lord , ” and he smiled , “ they said the same of Nan Swayle . ” “ Ah ! but that 's a lie , ” said the girl hotly . Hal laughed . “ Ay , ” he said , “ and maybe so is the tale of Pet Salt . Anyway , thy grandsire seems to thrive beneath her care , be she witch or no . Fie , Anny , for shame , ” he added , “ you would not haste back yet . Master French will not thank us if we get in so soon , stopping his love - talk with Mistress Sue . ” Anny wrapped her shawl a little closer about her head and shoulders , and slipped her arm through the boy 's , and they walked on for a while without speaking . About three hundred yards from the old hull Anny stopped . “ Look ! ” she said , “ he 's on deck . ” Hal looked in the direction in which she pointed and saw the stubby figure of old Ben Farran , a long telescope to his eye , leaning against the remnant of what had once been a neat deck - house . Lumber of different kinds -- mostly empty rum kegs -- lay strewn all round him , while from the shattered stump of the main - mast to the painted ear of the fearsome green - and - red dragon , which served as a figurehead , was stretched a clothes - line , on which a few rags leaped and fought in the cold breeze . Hal studied him critically for a few moments . “ He 's not so deep in liquor as usual , ” he said at last . “ Oh ! poor Pet Salt ! ” exclaimed the girl involuntarily . “ I wonder where she is ? ” “ Stowed away safely under hatches , I reckon , ” said Hal , with a laugh .	” he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he , he said , “ ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , “ ” he shook his arm , “ ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , “ ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he shook his arm , “ ” he said , “ ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ 
was out of the train just three seconds after the train - hands . To his surprise , neither of these men made any movement towards him : they stood watching , while a squad of soldiers followed their officers out of the rear cars . The officers and men wore the grey uniforms and green tejada - de - burro caps of the Nacionales . The officers plainly knew of Sard 's presence on the train . They came straight towards him with drawn revolvers in their hands . One of the officers was an elderly captain , fat , pompous , slow - witted , and with a face like a slab of something : the other was a little thin dapper lieutenant , with legs like pipestems cased in tight patent - leather boots to the knees . Sard knew at once that these men were coming back to barracks after being escort to a consignment of silver from the mines . He saluted the officers , who did not return his salute : on the contrary , they seemed indignant at his saluting . A couple of soldiers covered Sard with their rifles . “ Who are you ? ” the captain asked . Sard told him . “ So . You speak Spanish . What are you doing on the line ? ” Sard told him . “ A likely story , eh , lieutenant ? ” “ Very likely , my captain . ” “ You know the law against trespass on the line ? ” “ No , captain , ” Sard said . “ That is false , ” the captain answered ; “ since you know Spanish , you must know it . ” “ I am English , and do not , ” Sard said . “ That is false , ” the captain answered . “ You are not English . You are French . Your cap proves it . You are a deserter from the French ship which called here . ” “ If there be any English or Scotchman here , ” Sard said , “ or any American , I can prove that I am English . ” “ We desire no proof , since we need none . You were on the line , that suffices ; without papers , which clinches it . You are arrested . ” “ You had better not arrest me , ” Sard said ; “ in spite of my clothes , I am an officer , equal in rank to yourself . ” “ Enough words , ” the captain said . “ By many , too many words , ” the lieutenant said . “ At least , ” Sard said , “ you can telegraph to the British Consul at Las Palomas about me , or send me to him . ” “ It is not for you to prescribe our course of action , ”	” Sard said , “ eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , eh , ” Sard saluted .
brass earrings , “ Hijo de la gran puta . You dog - assassin of English ! ” He flung his knife at Sard with the backward flick from the wrist which “ takes a year to learn , ” so the bad men say . Had he flung the knife before screaming , Sard would have had the point through his throat , but the scream warned him ; he had time to dodge . The knife stuck in the bar . Sard pulled it out . The two men at the table woke up . “ Rough house , ” one of them said . “ Cut out your dam ' row and let us sleep , ” the other said . “ Carai , carai , carai , ” cried the man with brass earrings . “ I 'll give you dog - assassin with the bottle . ” He came across the table at Sard with a bottle , knocking over one of the sleepers as well as a bench . Floundering in this wreck , he himself fell , cursing . There came a scurry of swift yet heavy steps on the floor above . “ Beat it , Kid , ” the train - hand cried to Sard . “ Here 's the missus . ” He held the door open for Sard , who slipped through it to the front door , which was already open . He was moving swiftly , but had a glimpse as he fled of a monstrous woman , with an inflamed and frowsy face , who was floundering downstairs to him , calling him to stop . Something cracked the woodwork of the door to his left and something banged to his right : the woman was shooting at him . He reached the street , turned sharply , ran round the house , scrambled over a low wall into an enclosure , and ran along it , while the pursuit grew loud behind him . At the end of the enclosure there was a wall , which he climbed . As he climbed it , there came cries of “ There he is ! ” and bullets struck the wall and the earth beneath it . He dropped into a second enclosure . At the end of the enclosure there was a house , at the door of which a man lay in a chair taking his siesta with a gun upon his knees . The man woke up as Sard reached him , and at the same instant the pursuers reached the enclosure wall and opened fire . Sard slipped past the man in the chair into the house . He said , “ Excuse me , ” as he passed , and slammed the door behind him . There was a door on his left ; a woman opened it , asking him , in Spanish , what was the matter . He said	” Sard schrie , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er er schlug er er schlug er er schlug er er schlug er schlug er er schlug er er , er schlug er er schlug er , er schlug er schlug , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er schlug , er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug er , er schlug
sage brush . She was Lily of the West ; I was Rose of the South . She is dead , pobrecita , the Lily : she was of this world , which needs a man , not a woman : pobrecita mia . ” “ What is your real name ? ” Sard asked . “ Clara , ” she said , “ Clara of the Salt - Pans , the woman of Miguel , called Miguel sin Nada . ” “ He is Miguel con Mucha , with yourself , señora , ” Sard said . “ And now adios , and always my thanks , siempre , siempre , siempre . I will return your shoe by Miguel . ” “ For the love of all the saints in bliss , caballero , ” she said , “ in no way let Miguel suspect that you have talked with me . Ay de mi , we women ; we suffer for our hearts . Miguel is of a jealousy that would make proud , being such evidence of love , if it were not such inconvenience . A thought , a turn of the head , a look , and he at once ranks me with those infamous of life , with her of Sheba , and Ysabel , Queen of England . ” “ I will not let him suspect , ” Sard said . “ And now farewell , and my thanks and again my thanks . ” “ Stay yet , ” she said . “ Stay yet for one instant . I shall be here sixty years , perhaps , like Caterina La Fea , below , at the poblacion , old , old , and wrinkled like the devil , red - eyed , blind , from sitting in the smoke , sucking bits of meat at last , with her gums . And little children flinging dead rats at her and calling her Witch - Witch . I have had one instant with you ; let me have one other ; only one ; since it has to last for sixty years , you would not grudge me one instant ? Then when I am as Caterina , I shall think , ah , but truly I lived , once , at that midnight , when one like St. Gabriel came to my door , and was as a count or duke to me , who am Clara the woman of Miguel . ” “ Señora , ” Sard said , “ I , too , shall think of you , at times , for whatever years may remain to me ; but now I must go , and so I say again , thank you and farewell . ” He turned away as fast as he could hobble . “ Stay yet , ” she implored . “ I do not importune , but I do not know your name	, adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios , adios .
and killed him . With my own dose , in his own stronghold , I gave him Death . ” “ You were n't allowed to bury him , ” Sard said . It was a shot which went home . Plainly , the burial of Captain Cary by the murderer in the priest 's clothes would have given a relish to the crime . “ No matter , ” the Holy One answered , controlling his face , “ I shall bury you , when I have done with you . ” “ You have n't done with me yet , ” Sard said . “ And I owe you for Captain Cary . ” “ Your owners owe me for the ship . ” “ Perhaps I may pay that too . ” Sagrado walked to the throne in the apex of the room ; he seated himself and appeared to consider . Sard knew that he had touched the beast to the quick by his remark about the burial . He followed it up with : “ Mr. Dorney read the service very well , I understand . You did not numb his brains , I gather . ” “ He has few to numb , ” Sagrado answered . “ But I am thinking of what you said about payment , and of you paying me . You think yourself capable , do you , of standing in a contest with me ? ” “ I would do my best , the city scavenger being absent . ” Sagrado laughed , yet seemed still to be considering : he swayed a little to and fro . “ Yet it is absurd , ” he said . “ It would be no fair match . ” “ You are older , ” Sard said , “ that is true , but you are fresh . I have already fought twice this night . ” “ I had not heard that , ” Sagrado answered . “ I heard that you had been beaten : did you refer to that ? ” “ Yes , ” Sard said . “ That was not in my mind , ” Sagrado said , “ when I wondered at the fitness of the match . The issue is not between Master and servant , but between the civilised world and its Destroyer . You are disgusting to me , but not important enough . You are not master of your destiny . You are a part of the scum of life , which is active for another ( though without religion ) and worried for another , though without purpose . And your talk is such as one would expect : it is prejudice based on ignorance , just like your press . Your sports , your muscle , your fair play , all these catchwords which you repeat when people ask you for intelligence , degrade men .

. Tell me your name . I would think of your name and pray for you in the chapel and before the image here . ” “ My name is Harker . ” “ Harker . What does that mean ? ” “ I do not know : perhaps ‘ one who listens . ' ” “ Listens for what ? ” “ What do people listen for ? ” “ The sea wind in the heat , ” she said thoughtfully ; “ and the crowing of the cock in the night of pain ; and , in life , the footstep of the beloved who never comes ; or when he does come , goes on the instant . ” “ Good - bye . ” “ What do you listen for ? ” she cried . “ A change of wind , perhaps . Adios . ” He turned from her rapidly , but as he turned she knelt suddenly at his side , snatched his hand and kissed it . “ Thank you , ” he said , “ but men are not worthy of that , señora . ” He withdrew his hand and hobbled a few steps away . At this little distance , he called : “ I thank you , señora ; good night . ” He knew that she would not follow him into the darkness : she did not , but he heard her break into a wild crying of tears and lamentation . The last that he saw of her was the grey of her sacking and the pallor of her face , standing looking after him while she lifted up her voice and wept . Perhaps three - quarters of an hour after leaving Rose of the South , when it was ( as he judged ) a little after two in the morning , Sard saw in front of him the sheds of “ the siding beside the jetty . ” Sard could see no horses , but there was an engine on the line with steam up ; a glow was on the smoke coming from its funnel ; a glare from its fire made the stoker and driver ruddy with light . The engine was headed inland with a load of trucks coupled to it . Men were moving about between the quay and the trucks , either loading or unloading something heavy . At any other time he might have wondered why men were shipping copper - ore at midnight during a norther , though indeed the jetty was screened from the wind by the high land beyond it . He had no suspicion of these men . He was perhaps stupid from poison and fatigue ; he thought that he had reached his rest . One of the workers came away from the trucks to get a drink at a scuttle - butt .

for his crimes ! ... a Minister kidnapped ! ... the Chamber in consternation ! ... The whole country attacked in the person of its highest representatives ! ... Ah ! Fantômas is indeed a genius , the genius of audacity , the king of frightfulness , the monster that assails everything , that fears nothing , for whom nothing is sacred ! ” For the tenth time , Fandor re - read the article in _ La Capitale _ . On regaining the Rue Saint - Fargeau , worn out by the stress and strain of his visit to Elisabeth , he had heard the newsboys crying at the top of their voices the latest edition of _ La Capitale _ . People were fighting for the paper , passers - by reading the news with looks of horror and feverish excitement . No sooner had Fandor cast his eyes on the copy he had secured than he started violently . In enormous letters he read the headlines : “ _ Fantômas at work again.—A Minister carried off by brigands.—Fantômas demands a million francs to disappear . The Chamber votes defiance . _ ” Now , back in his garret two hours ago , Fandor was reading , still incapable , in the mad whirl of his thoughts , of regaining anything like calmness , the amazing details of the extraordinary sitting of the Chamber , the Chamber wherein Fantômas had thrown defiance , a veritable ultimatum to France , the sitting that had been held that same afternoon at the moment he was on his way to Mlle . Dollon 's . That Fantômas should strike a sudden blow , he reflected , a blow so extraordinary as the one he has just delivered , is astounding , but it is not perhaps so crushing as I thought at first . In any case , what a fine argument it supplies in Juve 's defence . If Fantômas manifests his activity abroad , in public , why , Juve can no longer be confounded with him , seeing Juve is a prisoner in the Santé ! Then , with ever increasing agitation , the journalist began to read the passage in the paper giving the shorthand report of the debate in the Chamber , which stated how his name , his , Jérôme Fandor 's name , had been uttered aloud as probably masking that of one of Fantômas ' chief accomplices . “ By the Lord ! ” soliloquized the young man , “ it 's plain enough ; everybody believes that Juve is Fantômas ! Now Juve is in gaol , debarred from action ; the inevitable conclusion , therefore , is that one of his lieutenants , one of his accomplices , must be credited with the atrocity of to - day .

. The lieutenant nodded and , his brows puckered , sat down . Turning to his visitor his eyes widened with surprise . “ Well , what 's the matter with you ? ” he exclaimed . “ You look as if you 'd seen the devil .... ” “ Perhaps , ” De Medici smiled faintly . His new fears had emptied him of the scene he had planned with the man — a casual and triumphant scene with Norton cringing and miserable . “ I 've had a rather bad night , ” he added vaguely . “ Well , ” the lieutenant shrugged , “ it 's been no worse a night than I 've had . ” Norton sighed and , leaning forward , placed his hand on De Medici 's knee . “ Young man , ” he continued , “ I feel I owe you an apology . ” “ Yes , ” De Medici agreed , “ I was coming to that . How is Miss Ballau ? ” The lieutenant smiled tiredly . “ Oh , do n't rub it in , ” he answered . “ Miss Ballau is quite well , I fancy . Have you seen her ? ” “ No , I just got here , ” De Medici said . “ I mean did you see her last night ? ” De Medici stared at the detective . “ Of course I saw her last night ... here . You were here .... ” “ I mean after our little party here , ” Norton went on . “ After I left ? ” De Medici began and paused . “ Yes . ” Norton 's wearied eyes confused him . After he had left ? Then .... “ Where is Miss Ballau ? ” he cried . “ Well , as I said before , ” Norton answered , “ I owe you an apology . We let her go almost immediately after you and the doctor left . The case against her has collapsed . That is , so far as her actual guilt is concerned . That 's why I called you over last night . I thought you might fill in the missing links . ” De Medici 's face remained without expression but his thoughts were circling wildly once more . Norton was still talking . “ It was a mistake to arrest her at all . I felt from the beginning that we were acting too hastily . But the burned note sort of decided things for me ... for a little while . But — there were too many unexplained things ... too many ends . So we let her go . It 's the only way .

Lady Beltham stopped suddenly . The bell of the house telephone that communicated with the porter 's lodge had just rung . Mechanically the great lady unhooked the receiver and listened . She was going to say no ! to the question asked by the servant speaking from the other end of the wire , but Fantômas , without the smallest scruple , had appropriated the second receiver . “ Ask him up , madam , ” he gave his orders , “ you can not do otherwise , you must ! ” Lady Beltham obeyed and gave the required answer to the servant : “ Ask Monsieur Ascott kindly to come upstairs ; show him into my rooms . ” * * * * * In the midst of that Parisian oasis formed by the Parc des Princes , Lady Beltham had for some months been in occupation , under the name of the Grand Duchess Alexandra , of a magnificent mansion standing in the middle of a vast park . The front of the house was approached by great gates of wrought iron , dividing the boulevard from a fine gravelled drive that swept round a lawn before the main entrance . Behind the building was a short cut leading from the offices and opening into a deserted by - street ; this could only be reached after crossing an orchard planted with fruit trees , a spot of quite a countrified and unpretending aspect . The path connecting the house with the exit into the by - street was completely overshadowed by a double row of clipped yews , a relic of a garden of an earlier date , and throughout its length were ranged a number of beehives , giving this part of the garden a homely and utilitarian appearance , a charm that was at once restful and picturesque . While Lady Beltham was awaiting the visitor whom , at Fantômas ' unexpected order , she had decided to receive , and was endeavouring to restore to her features , distorted by the agitations she had gone through , some appearance of calm and composure , the monstrous malefactor , who had for months duped all Paris , passing himself off as the American detective , Tom Bob , slipped away softly into the adjoining room , under pretext of an intention to listen to the conversation the wealthy young Englishman wished to have with the lady he doubtless still took to be the Grand Duchess Alexandra . But anyone who could have seen Fantômas when alone in the room would surely have suspected the man of some more sinister motive . The brigand did not stay near the half open door , shielded though it was by a heavy curtain . With preoccupied air and a brow wrinkled in anxious thought , he stepped up to the window , and long and carefully scrutinized what lay outside , if by any chance he might	                                                         
a story . Donovan , the doorman , greeted him . “ Good morning , ” he said . “ There 's quite a crowd , sir . ” De Medici nodded . He recalled there was to be an auction of the Ballau treasures . Money was needed to pay the dead man 's debts and provide his daughter with expenses . “ Started yet ? ” he asked . “ Yes . ” Donovan 's eyes took in the vestibule . He came a step closer and added : “ You know , Mr. De Medici , there 's been a lot of clews around here . ” De Medici assumed an air of polite conspiratorial interest . “ Yes , ” went on Donovan , “ and I did n't tell all I knew to none of them , seeing it was n't anything that would help . But I 'll tell you , sir . Things were n't all right in the Ballau apartment for some time . Many the time I 've passed their door and heard screaming . A woman screaming and Mr. Ballau arguing with her .... ” The doorman straightened and resumed his doorman manner . A group of visitors to the auction had entered . “ We 'll talk more about it later , ” De Medici murmured and stepped toward the elevator . Voices came from behind the closed door of the Ballau apartment . De Medici pressed the bell and waited . The door opened slowly . A sound of chattering and laughter struck him . “ Hello , ” he bowed to the woman who had admitted him . Jane . He looked curiously at her . For a moment he had failed to recognize her . “ In there , sir , ” she said , indicating the crowded library . “ Have they started yet , Jane ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ And how have you been ? I have n't seen you since the inquest . ” She shook her head . Tears lighted her haggard eyes . “ They 're selling all his things , ” she whispered ; “ all his nice things . ” “ Has Miss Ballau been here yet ? ” She stared at him . “ Miss Ballau ! ” she repeated . “ She ... she was arrested . ” The old woman 's shoulders fell and tears rolled over her thin cheeks . “ Miss Ballau was released last night , ” De Medici said softly . “ She 's quite all right now .... ” “ Thank God ! ” Jane nodded . He walked toward the crowded room . He would talk to her later . Florence had induced her to perjure herself . He recalled Donovan ... a woman screaming and Ballau arguing with her . Yes , maybe Jane could help out .... In the library he took his	De Medici , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es , er sah es .
died . You can see from the standpoint of heredity what took place . The sadistic strain in the blood of the grandfather mixed in the unbalanced blood of the woman — and the minister was the result . From such a type you look for your odd reforms — your fantastic crimes . ” In the silence which followed there came the plaintive voice of the chief : “ But still I do n't understand why he killed Warren . ” “ Well , ” came Bartley 's voice , “ let us start at the beginning . Here you have the minister . His heredity is very bad . His entire life , that is , the things he did , showed that he was a sad neurotic . He hated pleasure ; he hated all things which normal people enjoy . In fact most of the wild , rabid fanatics are the same type . But with him there was a double danger . “ We know to - day that there is not much difference between the person who reacts violently in a sexual manner and the one who goes to a wild extreme in religious matters . Our psychology has proven they are alike , from hundreds of cases . You had here an unbalanced man . The anti - evolution group , of which he was a member , had read Warren 's statement — the last proof of evolution had been found . Now to him that would be absurd ; and , at the same time , he would look upon Warren as an enemy of God . “ Let us suppose he brooded over the matter day after day . He might have even prayed that Warren would be found wrong . Then to add flame to his unbalanced thoughts came the news that Warren was to write his book in the very place where the minister lived . That did not improve matters . So one day he went to see Warren . I think I can picture what happened . ” “ What ? ” came the chief 's eager voice . “ I think the minister went into Warren 's library with the purpose of begging that he would not publish his book . In his unbalanced mind he would see nothing out of the way in such a request . You can picture what Warren must have said . It was like oil to a flame . As the minister looked at the scientist he would see him as the very enemy of society . Then , without a doubt , something snapped in his brain . He rose to say ‘ good - by ' and suddenly stabbed him . In his first wild frenzy he thought of himself as doing the work of God . The cross was a symbol of that . And when he wrote the word ‘ Ananias , ' the same	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
that it was a way up this cliff . As it was a possible means of getting back to his course , he set himself to climb it . It took him an hour to reach the top , and as he scrambled up to safety above it , the thongs of his ollas broke , and both jars dropped to the bottom of the chimney and smashed to pieces there . He found himself on a great heave of rocky mountain which went on to a pine forest . Beyond the pine forest the main crags of the Sierra rose , covered with snow . They were blindingly bright in front of him , rocks as blue as steel and ice as white as death , a wall between him and the sea , which he would have to climb . At about sunset , when he was entered into the pine forest , he smelled suddenly a smell of smoke . It was the smoke of burning pine - cones or pine - needles . He judged that it came from a little fire , because he so easily lost the scent . He turned towards it , thinking that even the most savage of mountain Indians would be less terrible than that loneliness . Sometimes he lost the scent , then he cast about like a dog , until he picked it up again . Presently he was almost certain that he heard a moan . It seemed the fitting speech for such a place . He went towards it , and soon heard the moaning pass into something much more savage , a cursing and a calling down of vengeance . After a minute of violence , it died again into grief and mourning and lamentation . He went towards the noise and came round some great rocks on to a scene which he remembered until he died . There was an open space there with the tracks of men and horses on the sandy floor of the pine forest . Someone had kindled a little fire there , and the ground was littered with bits of tamales . Beyond the fire , swinging so that his feet were sometimes covered by gusts of the smoke , a dead man hung from a pine branch . At the foot of the tree , crouched and moaning , was a woman . She was rocking to and fro with her grief . From time to time she stretched her arms abroad and cursed and screamed in a kind of rhythm or poetry of hate . Then the grief again became too strong for her , and she moaned and lamented . One of the dead man 's slippers had fallen into the fire and lay half burnt there . There was a paper pinned upon his chest , with the word “ Traitor ” drawn on it with a burnt stick . The paper was a coarse	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
stood braced , horn to horn , like bulls . On both occasions these visits had terminated abruptly in less than a week . The bare , wind - swept little town , winter - locked , had seemed unspeakably dreary to Magnolia . In the chill parlour of the cottage there was a wooden portrait of her father done in crayon . It was an enlargement which Parthy had had done from a small photograph of Andy in his blue coat and visored cap and baggy wrinkled pants . An atrocious thing , but the artist , clumsy though he was , had somehow happened to catch the alert and fun - loving brightness of the keen brown eyes . The mutton - chop whiskers looked like tufts of dirty cotton ; the cheeks were pink as a chorus girl 's . But the eyes were Andy 's . Magnolia wandered into the parlour to stand before this picture , looking up at it with a smile . She wandered , too , down to the river to gaze at the sluggish yellow flood thick now with ice , but as enthralling as ever to her . She stood on the river bank in her rich furs , a lonely , wind - swept figure , gazing down the river , down the river , and her eyes that had grown so weary with looking always at great gray buildings and grim gray streets and swarming gray crowds now lost their look of strain , of unrepose , as they beheld in the far still distance the lazy Southern wharves , the sleepy Southern bayous — Cairo , Memphis , Vicksburg , Natchez , New Orleans — Queenie , Jo , Elly , Schultzy , Andy , Julie , Steve . She took Kim eagerly to the water 's edge — gave her the river with a sweep of her arm . Kim did not like it . “ Is that the river ? ” she asked . “ Why , yes , darling . Do n't you remember ! The river ! ” “ The river you told me about ? ” “ Of course ! ” “ It 's all dirty and ugly . You said it was beautiful . ” “ Oh , Kim , is n't it ? ” “ No . ” She showed her the picture of Captain Andy . “ Grampa ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Cap'n ? ” “ Yes , dear . He used to laugh so when you called him that when you were a little baby . Look at his eyes , Kim . Are n't they nice ? He 's laughing . ” “ He 's funny - looking , ” said Kim . Parthy asked blunt questions . “ Sherman House ? What do you go living in a hotel for all these years , with the way they charge for food and all	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
gone and he floundered , gasping . Joe looked at him critically . “ You wo n't come near my wife no more , ” he observed , as he threw the helpless man a line . “ Oh , no , you ca n't come in my boat dripping as ye are , ” he said cheerily as the other , wild - eyed and half - drowned , clawed at the boat . “ You hang on that there line and I 'll tow ye in , ” Joe continued , and suiting the action to the word picked up both oars and struck out . When at last the keel grated on the soft shingle , Joe got out and after first dropping his anchor looked round for Blueneck . The man lay still in the water , both hands tightly grasping the line , the ripple of the waves tossing him to and fro . Joe dragged him in , threw him down on a bank of dry seaweed , and stood looking at him for a minute or two . “ Ah , I wonder if he be dead now , ” he said to himself , and he bent down to lift the sailor 's eyelids . He tore open the wet remains of Blueneck 's best surcoat and put his hand in the left side . Then he stood up and shrugged his shoulders . “ Ah , well ! ” he said , addressing the unconscious body , “ seeing that you ai n't dead , you may as well live , but you do n't come round my house in a hurry again , or there wo n't be any not quite dead about it -- see ? ” Blueneck opened his eyes for a second and then fell back again into unconsciousness . Joe looked round him , heaved a sigh of relief and , as he strolled off up to the Ship , his face assumed once more its wonted good humour , his heavy sandy lashes fell half over his eyes as usual , and , thrusting his thumbs in his belt , he whistled as clearly , happily , and tunefully as a linnet in May . CHAPTER XI Everything on the shore was very dark and very silent when Blueneck regained consciousness and sat up . His head ached and his body was stiff and cold while his clothes , still wet and sticky with brine , clung to him uncomfortably . He peered round in the darkness , striving to remember where he was and what had happened to him . There was no moon , or at least if there was it was so hidden behind the clouds as to be of no use to any one , and he could only faintly distinguish a kind of haze some quarter of a mile in front of him which he supposed was the sea .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

were for me to find the switch for the lights . The button was near the door , and , pressing it , the room in an instant was a blaze of light . The room was octagonal in shape , with a window placed high on each of the sides . The wall space was filled with bookcases , and there must have been many thousand volumes . A gallery at a height of around twelve feet ran completely around the room . Even this was filled with books . The furniture was simple . Near the door stood a safe , and there were a number of stands in various corners . But in the center of the room was the largest desk I had ever seen — a huge affair made out of an old - fashioned square piano — with its surface littered with books and papers . Near it stood a typewriter stand , with the machine uncovered . And then , suddenly , we saw something else — something which drove all other thoughts from our minds . Peering from behind the desk was a foot — a foot which did not move . We must have seen it at the same moment , for Carter 's hand gripped my arm , and for a second we stood silent . Then without a word slowly we went across the floor , knowing what we would find . Though we were sure what was behind the desk , yet it came as a shock . For there , lying on his back upon the floor — with both arms outstretched from the body — lay a man . A man to whom the dinner waiting in the big house would never matter ; and it needed but a glance to know that death had come suddenly — and violently . As Ranville 's eyes and mine met , they framed the same question . It was Carter who spoke the two words : “ It 's Warren . ” The scientist was a man of about fifty , and perhaps a little over that age . The face was self - willed , and the lines around the distorted lips were stern . Though past middle life , his hair was a dense black , without a sign of gray , and there was not a white hair in the close - cropped mustache . One could tell by his figure that he had been a man of the strongest physique . He was dressed in a light summer suit , without a coat , and upon the white shirt , just over the heart , was a crimson stain . Carter dropped on his knees and made a hasty examination . In a second he turned and pointed with his finger at the dark stain upon the white shirt . Then as he straightened up we saw something else — something we had overlooked	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
at the sides . High up in the centre of it was a trophy of a horned beast 's head : it looked like a giant goat 's head ; something odd had been done to it . The smell of sweet leather was much stronger at that end of the hall . There were figures painted on the panels , at both sides of the trophy . The paint was trickling down the wall . “ Someone has been burning carib leaf , ” Hilary whispered . “ There must be a door , ” Sard whispered back . “ Only it is let in flush with the panels . We must strike a light . ” “ Go ahead then , ” Hilary muttered . At that instant there came a little suck of air , Sard 's propping gave way before it , the hall door shut to with a crash . “ I say , you are a pearl of a door - fastener , ” Hilary said . “ Hush ! Watch for a light . ” They watched ; but no light showed and no sound came . “ Nobody stirring , ” Sard said ; “ the breeze is rising . We must leave the door . Look there . ” “ What ? ” “ A man looking in at the window at us . ” “ Can he see us ? ” “ Not possibly . ” “ Who is he ? ” “ I ca n't see . ” “ Is he a civil guard ? ” “ He 's not wearing a helmet . ” “ Do you think he can be coming in here ? ” “ No . He would come in if he belonged here . There , he has gone . He was only some passer - by . ” “ It 's an odd time of morning for a passer - by , ” Hilary said . “ There . It is striking two . ” “ Look here , ” Sard said , stooping down ; “ I 've guessed the secret of this wall . It has no door ; but it slides in grooves to and fro . They seem to have oiled the runners . I 'm going to strike a light to see which way the thing runs . Hold this twine : it is tarry . I 'll light it . It will make a candle . ” He took a small hank of roping twine , lit it and held it to the wall . “ Look here , ” he said , “ at what is on my hands : blood . This which I thought was oil is blood . There can be no doubt of that . They have spattered blood all over this wall here . ” “ They have killed her , then ! ” “ Not they . This is not	” he muttered , “ It 's a stooping stooping stooping stooping . ” “ It 's a stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping stooping , ” he said . “ It 's a , ” he said . “ It 's , ” he said . “ It 's , ” he said , “ It 's , ” he said , “ It 's , ” he said , “ It 's , ” he said , “ It 's , ” he said , “ It 's , ” he said , “ It 's .
days of swords , satins , and periwigs . Mrs. Hawks was , after all , a woman ; and no woman could look unmoved upon the figure of cool elegance that now stood before her . “ Sakes alive ! ” she said , inadequately . Frank , whose costumes , ashore or afloat , always were négligée to the point of causing the beholder some actual nervousness , attempted to sneer without the aid of make - up and made a failure of it . Ravenal now addressed Mrs. Hawks . “ You are not staying long ashore , I hope ? ” “ And why not ? ” inquired Mrs. Hawks , with her usual delicacy . “ I had hoped that perhaps you and Captain Hawks and Miss Magnolia might do me the honour of dining with me ashore and going to the theatre afterward . I know a little restaurant where — — ” “ Likely , ” retorted Parthy , by way of polite refusal ; and moved majestically down the gangplank , followed by the gratified heavy . Ravenal continued thoughtfully on his way . Captain Andy was in the box office just off the little forward deck that served as an entrance to the show boat . With him was Magnolia — Magnolia minus her mother 's protecting wings . After all , even Parthy had not the power to be in more than one place at a time . At this moment she was deep in conversation with Flat Foot on the wharf . Magnolia was evidently dressed for a festive occasion . The skirt of her light écru silk dress was a polonaise draped over a cream - white surah silk , and the front of the tight bodice - basque was of the same cream - white stuff . Her round hat of Milan straw , with its modishly high crown , had an artful brim that shaded her fine eyes , and this brim was faced with deep rose velvet , and a bow of deep rose flared high against the crown . The black of her hair was all the blacker for this vivid colour . An écru parasol and long suède gloves completed the costume . She might have stepped out of _ Harper 's Bazaar_—in fact , she had . The dress was a faithful copy of a costume which she had considered particularly fetching as she pored over the pages of that book of fashion . Andy was busy at his desk . Ranged in rows on that desk were canvas sacks , plump , squat ; canvas sacks limp , lop - sided ; canvas sacks which , when lifted and set down again , gave forth a pleasant clinking sound . Piled high in front of these were neat packets of green - backs , ones and ones and ones , in bundles of fifty , each bound with a tidy belt	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
said carelessly , and wondered why the Spaniard should laugh so triumphantly at his answer . Some minutes later all was still in the Ship Tavern . Hal Grame alone stood before the fast - graying embers in the kitchen , thinking miserably . For the first time since he could remember , his childhood 's sweetheart had forgotten to kiss him as she bade him good - night . CHAPTER V “ An excellent repast , fair mistress , and one I warrant you well appreciated . ” Black'erchief Dick pushed the empty platter from before him , leaned back in his seat , and looked round the room with approval . It was six o'clock in the morning ; and although only a faint grayish light was beginning to steal in the windows and the air was cool and slightly rum - tainted , the kitchen in the old Ship Inn presented a cheerful and lively scene of domestic bustle . The fire , though newly lighted , blazed brightly and the logs , some with the hoar - frost still glittering on them , crackled and spat merrily . Hal , his boyish face glowing after a hasty splash at the well - nigh frozen pump , hastened to and fro from the scullery to the kitchen , bearing great trays of newly washed tankards , while Sue , a little paler than on the preceding night , but all the same retaining most of her usual good humour , her sleeves rolled high above her elbows and a sail - cloth apron tied about her waist , appeared from time to time in the open doorway between the kitchen and the back scullery , whence the pleasant smell of cooking emerged . Gilbot was yet abed but his seat with its old hay - stuffed cushions was put in readiness for his coming , in his favourite corner by the fireplace . One of the long tressle - tables had been pulled out into the wider part of the room clear of the high - backed seats and it was here , one at either end of the table , that Black'erchief Dick and Big French sat in tall , wooden , box - like chairs , finishing the first meal of the day . Anny waited on them . This morning she was more beautiful than on the evening before . At least so thought the Spaniard as he watched her trip to and fro with a wooden platter or an earthen pitcher of home - brewed ale in her hands . Her cheeks seemed to him to have more colour in them , her little bare feet , as they pattered over the stones , more elasticity and lightness of touch , and her wonderful , shadowed green eyes , more mirth and gaiety than he had noticed before . As she moved about she sang little snatches of old songs in a lulling	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
ty TUM - ty - ty TUM - TUM - TUM and then I vamp . It kind of went sour to - night , seemed to me . A bit of supper . Coffee cooked over a spirit lamp . Lumps of yellow cheese , a bite of ham . Relaxation after strain . A daubing with cold cream . A sloshing of water . Quieter . More quiet . Quiet . Darkness . Security . No sound but that of the river flowing by . Sometimes if she dozed she was wakened by the familiar hoot of a steamer whistle — some big lake boat , perhaps , bound for Michigan or Minnesota ; or a river barge or tug on the Chicago River near by . She would start up , bewildered , scarcely knowing whether she had heard this hoarse blast or whether it was only , after all , part of her dream about the river and the _ Cotton Blossom _ . Ravenal coming swiftly up the stairs . Ravenal 's quick light tread in the hall . “ Come on , Nola ! We 're leaving this rat 's nest . ” “ Gay , dear ! Not now . You do n't mean to - night . ” “ Now ! It 'll only take a minute . I 'll wake up the slavey . She 'll help . ” “ No ! No ! I 'd rather do it myself . Oh , Gay , Kim 's asleep . Ca n't we wait until morning ? ” But somehow the fantastic procedure appealed tremendously to her love of the unexpected . Packing up and moving on . The irresponsible gaiety of it . The gas turned high . Out tumbled the contents of bureau drawers and boxes and trunks . Finery saved from just such another lucky day . Froth and foam of lace and silk strewn incongruously about this murky little chamber with its frayed carpet and stained walls and crazy chairs . They spoke in half whispers so as not to wake the child . They were themselves like two children , eager , excited , laughing . “ Where are we going , Gay ? ” “ Sherman . Or how would you like to try the Auditorium for a change ? Rooms looking out over the lake . ” “ Gay ! ” Her hands clasped as she knelt in front of a trunk . “ Next week we 'll run down to West Baden . Do us good . During the day we can walk and drive or ride . You ought to learn to ride , Nola . In the evening we can take a whirl at Sam Maddock 's layout . ” “ Oh , do n't play there — not much , I mean . Let 's try to keep what we have for a little while . ” “ After all ,	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
deck a big ship 's lantern stood on the stump of the main - mast while two smaller ones hung on each side of it ; they showed sick and yellow in the half - light . Standing before this improvised altar was a man dressed as a priest . He held a book in his hand and was mumbling to himself nervously in a foreign tongue . On either side of him were Blueneck and Noah Goody ; their knives were drawn and their faces set like wooden masks . Before them , in a gorgeous ill - fitting gown of yellow Lyons silk which Dick had brought and insisted on her wearing , stood Anny . Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes dancing with excitement . Round her neck hung a great silver pendant studded with garnets , and every now and then her hand would stray up to this and her fingers caress it lovingly , half wonderingly . On the little brown hand shone a ring ; it was an extraordinary jewel , consisting of a little gold hoop supporting a large flower , each petal of which was a different kind of stone : diamond , ruby , emerald , onyx , pearl , and sapphire , with a little piece of amber for the centre . Dick had told her that it was very old when he had put it on her finger , and she looked at it with something very like awe . Behind her stood Ben and Pet ; the old man swayed to and fro drunkenly , taking little or no interest in the proceedings , but the old woman watched eagerly , half enviously , her bleared eyes following Anny 's every movement and each gleam of the jewels , her quick ears catching each word that was spoken . Nothing escaped her , and she noticed that the priest 's garments were made for a much larger man , and that his book was upside down , but she said nothing and merely smiled wickedly to herself as the ceremony went on . The men on the beach below were not long in obeying their captain 's order , and in a minute the toast was given . “ Health and good fortune to the Captain 's lady ! ” Everybody drank heartily , the priest more than any one , and Dick , his brocaded coat and soft lace ruffles shining in the dim light , and his black curls showing a little more than usual from under his black kerchief , raised his glass above his head and taking Anny by the hand threw back his head and laughed joyously . He had once again got his own way in spite of difficulties . He drained off his liquor , and throwing the empty glass over his head began to sing : “ _ Fair as the Island , and proud as the sea ,

willing to marry you -- now that I know you could deceive me -- that you could go on deceiving me day after day for months . ” Peter thought she was going to break out into hysterics again , and he was frightened . He tried to plead with her , but suddenly she sprang up . “ Go away ! ” she exclaimed . “ Please go away and let me alone . I 'll think it over and decide what to do myself . Whatever I do , I wo n't disgrace you , so leave me alone , go quickly ! ” Section 26 She drove him out of the house , and Peter went , though with many misgivings . He wandered about the streets , not knowing what to do with himself , looking back over the blunders he had made and tormenting himself with that most tormenting of all thoughts : how different my life might have been , if only I had had sense enough to do this , or not to do that ! Dinner time came , and Peter blew himself to a square meal , but even that did not comfort him entirely . He pictured Sadie coming home at this hour . Was Jennie telling her or not ? There was a big mass meeting called by the Goober Defense Committee that evening , and Peter attended , and it proved to be the worst thing he could have done . His mind was in no condition to encounter the fierce passions of this crowded assemblage . Peter had the picture of himself being exposed and denounced ; he was n't sure yet that it might n't happen to him . And here was this meeting -- thousands of workingmen , horny handed blacksmiths , longshoremen with shoulders like barns and truckmen with fists like battering rams , long - haired radicals of a hundred dangerous varieties , women who waved red handkerchiefs and shrieked until to Peter they seemed like gorgons with snakes instead of hair . Such were the mob - frenzies engendered by the Goober case ; and Peter knew , of course , that to all these people he was a traitor , a poisonous worm , a snake in the grass . If ever they were to find out what he was doing -- if for instance , someone were to rise up and expose him to this crowd -- they would seize him and tear him to pieces . And maybe , right now , little Jennie was telling Sadie ; and Sadie would tell Andrews , and Andrews would become suspicious , and set spies on Peter Gudge ! Maybe they had spies on him already , and knew of his meetings with McGivney ! Haunted by such terrors , Peter had to listen to the tirades of Donald Gordon , of John Durand , and of Sorensen , the longshoremen	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Deirdre stood a moment looking about her . Her face , under the flat little yellow straw hat crossed by a red ribband that tied under her chin , was very winsome , her eyes bright with tears and laughter . When she saw Steve in the doorway , she ran to him and threw her arms around him . """""""" Oh , it 's good to be here again , Uncle Stevie , """""""" she - cried . He chuckled delightedly .

the hall for our hats , all at once the door bell rang — a long , shrill ring which died away , only to be repeated . With a bound and a growl Trouble gave one leap , waking from his sound sleep , and rushed to the hall . As I was the closest to the front door , I went to open it , wondering who it might be . Pushing the growling dog behind me , I opened the door to find a messenger boy standing there . With a half grin he extended a telegram in my direction . I signed the book , gave the boy a tip , and brought the yellow envelope into the house . As I glanced at it , I saw it was addressed to Carter . Bartley took the telegram , and after a look at the name said that he thought he had better open it . He tore the thin paper , took out the message and slowly read it through . As he glanced over the words , I saw his eyebrows raise a little . Then he said , turning to us both : “ Listen to this . It will interest you . ” “ Washington , D. C. “ Know nothing of man you wired about under name given . No one that name ever connected with Embassy either here or London . Description given does not fit any one we have information about . Am wiring San Francisco and New York . “ Wing . ” As he finished reading it , he saw that Ranville was not familiar with the name which was signed to the telegram , so he said : “ This is the answer to the message you told me Carter sent to his chief in Washington . Wing is the head of the identification end of the Secret Service . From what he says you can see they do not know your Chinese friend . ” Ranville 's face clouded for a moment . He informed us he had been of the opinion that the oriental had told us the truth . He added , there was only one explanation of his visit that now seemed reasonable . As we both waited for him to tell us what he thought , he continued : “ Our Chinese gentleman must have come here more to see if we had any suspicions of him than anything else . He had his nerve at that . He must have known Carter is with the secret service , and that I am in the same line myself . He was fishing for information . ” Bartley nodded , agreeing : “ You are right . But at the same time I have an idea that he came for another reason also . It was information he wanted , but information of another type , perhaps . ” As we both	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
it most carefully , because before long the time was coming when Peter would n't have Nell to coach him , and must be prepared to stand on his own legs . Peter knew that , and his legs failed him . He wanted to back down , and declare that he could n't go ahead with it ; he wanted to go to McGivney and confess everything . Nell divined what was going on in his soul , and wished to save him the humiliation of having it known . She sat close to him on the bench , and put her hand on his as she talked to him , and presently Peter felt a magic thrill stealing over him . He ventured to put his arm about Nell , to get still more of this delicious sensation ; and Nell permitted the embraces , for the first time she even encouraged them . Peter was a hero now , he was undertaking a bold and desperate venture ; he was going to put it thru like a man , and win Nell 's real admiration . “ Our country 's at war ! ” she exclaimed . “ And these devils are stopping it ! ” So pretty soon Peter was ready to face the whole world ; Peter was ready to go himself and blow up the king of American City with a dynamite bomb ! In that mood he stayed thru the small hours of the morning , sitting on the bench clasping his girl in his arms , and wishing she would give a little more time to heeding his love - making , and less to making him recite his lessons . Section 44 So the day began to break and the birds to sing . The sun rose on Peter 's face gray with exhaustion and the Irish apples in Nell 's cheeks badly faded . But the time for action had come , and Peter went off to watch McCormick 's home until seven o'clock , when the special delivery letter was due to arrive . It came on time , and Peter saw McCormick come out of the house and set forth in the direction of the studios . It was too early for the meeting , so Peter figured that he would stop to get his breakfast ; and sure enough “ Mac ” turned into , a little dairy lunch , and Peter hastened to the nearest telephone and called his boss . “ Mr. McGivney , ” he said , “ I lost those fellows last night , but now I got them again . They decided not to do anything till today . They 're having a meeting this morning and we 've a chance to nab them all . ” “ Where ? ” demanded McGivney . “ Room seventeen in the studios ; but do n't let any of your men go near there	” Peter sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat , he sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , and sat down on the bench , sat down on the bench , and sat down
the detective 's invitation Fandor had at last installed himself comfortably in a big armchair . “ Moche 's associates , ” he said , “ are a deplorably bad lot ; to begin with , amongst other notorious ruffians , I can give you the names , or rather the nicknames , of several , ‘ Beardy , ' ‘ the Beadle , ' ‘ the Cellarman,'—women too , ‘ Big Ernestine , ' little Nini , who , I told you before , has for her fancy man , the bully Paulet — calls himself a stone - mason , even works at his trade in his spare moments , for I know Moche has lately given him several jobs to do ; then there is ‘ Beauty Boy , ' another choice blackguard , and ... ” But Tom Bob suddenly interrupted his informant . “ I am dog tired , ” he declared , “ and half dropping asleep . Listen here , Monsieur Fandor , my own opinion is , an investigation is advisable before deciding on anything . I give you my word I will investigate ... ” CHAPTER XII A STROKE OF GENIUS The American detective Tom Bob was no ordinary man . The very first day after his arrival he had signalized his presence and drawn public attention to himself in a manner at once original and redounding greatly to his credit . Within a few hours of landing on French soil he had shown his mettle by the arrest of a dangerous malefactor , a professional criminal , “ Beauty Boy , ” the apache . The same day he had adroitly escaped an abominable attempt on his life , and , to crown all , in the course of a series of interviews accorded to the reporters of the different newspapers , he had , in direct contradiction to the generally received opinion , stoutly maintained that the ex - journalist Fandor , the bosom friend of the man Juve , now incarcerated in the prison of _ La Santé _ , was a very honest man , the last person to have committed the crimes imputed to him . * * * * * For several days , in fact up to the time Tom Bob had come to divert the public curiosity , the Inspectors of the Criminal Investigation Bureau had carried out the most minute investigations at the house where the bank messenger 's murder was supposed , if not to have been committed , at any rate to have been planned and prepared . For whole days together police - officers in plain clothes pursued careful inquiries , questioning the inmates , even going so far as to collect evidence as to the past life and antecedents of each of the tenants . True , no actual trace had been found of the unfortunate employé of the Comptoir National , but the uniform button discovered in	                                                         
, and having no remotest idea what it was all about . A crowd suggested one thing to Peter . For seven years of his young life he had been assistant to Pericles Priam , and had traveled over America selling Priam 's Peerless Pain Paralyzer ; they had ridden in an automobile , and wherever there was a fair or a convention or an excursion or a picnic , they were on hand , and Pericles Priam would stop at a place where the crowds were thickest , and ring a dinner bell , and deliver his super - eloquent message to humanity -- the elixir of life revealed , suffering banished from the earth , and all inconveniences of this mortal state brought to an end for one dollar per bottle of fifteen per cent opium . It had been Peter 's job to handle the bottles and take in the coin ; and so now , when he saw the crowd , he looked about him eagerly . Perhaps there might be here some vender of corn - plasters or ink - stain removers , or some three card monte man to whom Peter could attach himself for the price of a sandwich . Peter wormed his way thru the crowd for two or three blocks , but saw nothing more promising than venders of American flags on little sticks , and of patriotic buttons with “ Wake up America ! ” But then , on the other side of the street at one of the crossings Peter saw a man standing on a truck making a speech , and he dug his way thru the crowd , elbowing , sliding this way and that , begging everybody 's pardon -- until at last he was out of the crowd , and standing in the open way which had been cleared for the procession , a seemingly endless road lined with solid walls of human beings , with blue - uniformed policemen holding them back . Peter started to run across -- and at that same instant came the end of the world . Section 2 One who seeks to tell about events in words comes occasionally upon a fundamental difficulty . An event of colossal and overwhelming significance may happen all at once , but the words which describe it have to come one by one in a long chain . The event may reveal itself without a moment 's warning ; but if one is to give a sense of it in words , one must prepare for it , build up to it , awaken anticipation , establish a climax . If the description of this event which fate sprung upon Peter Gudge as he was crossing the street were limited to the one word “ BANG ” in letters a couple of inches high across the page , the impression would hardly be adequate . The end of the world , it seemed	Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam , Priam 
and his view the sordid street that held it , apparently disturbed his equanimity not at all . On rising he had observed exactly the same niceties that would have been his had he enjoyed the services of a hotel valet . He bathed , shaved , dressed meticulously . Magnolia had early learned that the slatternly morning habits which she had taken for granted in the _ Cotton Blossom _ wives — Julie , Mis ' Means , Mrs. Soaper , even the rather fastidious Elly — would be found inexcusable in the wife of Ravenal . The sternly utilitarian undergarments of Parthy 's choosing had soon enough been done away with , to be replaced with a froth of lace and tucks and embroidery and batiste . The laundering of these was a pretty problem when faro 's frown decreed Ohio Street . Ravenal was spared these worrisome details . Once out of the dingy boarding house , he could take his day in his two hands and turn it over , like a bright , fresh - minted coin . Each day was a new start . How could you know that you would not break the bank ! It had been done on a dollar . Down the street Ravenal would stroll past the ship chandlers ' and commission houses south of Ontario , to the swinging bridge that spanned the slimy river . There he would slacken his already leisurely pace , or even pause a moment , perhaps , to glance at the steamers tied up at the docks . There was an occasional sailboat . A three - masted schooner , _ The Finney _ , a grain boat , was in from up North . Over to Clark and Lake . You could sniff in the air the pleasant scent of coffee . That was Reid & Murdock 's big warehouse a little to the east . He sometimes went a block out of his way just to sniff this delicious odour . A glittering shoeshine at the Sherman House or the Tremont . “ Good - morning , George . ” “ Mawnin ' Mist ' Ravenal ! Mawnin ' ! Papah , suh ? ” “ Ah — n - n - no . No . H'm ! ” His fifty cents , budgeted , did not include the dispensing of those extra pennies for the _ Times - Herald _ , the _ Inter - Ocean _ , or the _ Tribune _ . They could be seen at McDonald 's for nothing . A fine Chicago morning . The lake mist had lifted . That was one of the advantages of never rising early . Into the Cockeyed Bakery for breakfast . To - morrow it would be Boyle 's . Surely his bad luck would break to - day . He felt it . Had felt it the moment he opened his eyes . “ Terrapin and	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .
Amy sat by the fireside , sewing . The five children were asleep upstairs and everything was quiet . Opposite her in the chimney corner , his heavy rain - sodden boots smoking in the heat , sat Blueneck , his unshaven chin resting in his hands . On the table lay the woollen cap and heavy coat which he had thrown off on entering . The water which dripped off the skirts of the coat made a little puddle on the clean red and yellow bricks of the floor . “ You 're a kind man , Master Blueneck , to come trudging all this way in the soaking rain to cheer a poor woman whose husband is too surly to tell her of the doings of the Island , ” said the lady , looking up from her mending , after a silence of a few minutes . “ Ah , señora . ” Mistress Pullen blushed with pleasure at the sound of the foreign address . “ Where on the Island is better company than yourself ? ” said the sailor gallantly , leaning a little forward so that the firelight played on the brass earrings that shone amongst the short oily curls hanging down the sides of his face . Mistress Pullen giggled and applied herself industriously to her needlework . “ I warrant me you 're not so well served at the Ship as you were at the Victory , Master Blueneck ? ” she said without looking up . Blueneck laughed bitterly . “ You 're right , mistress , ” he said , forgetting the “ señora ” to Amy 's disappointment . “ The Ship is none so bad a tavern , as taverns are nowadays , but ' tis of a truth much inferior to the Victory . ” “ I wonder that the Captain rests him there then ? ” said Mistress Amy , glancing under her lashes at her visitor . “ Marry , so do I. ” Blueneck 's tone was almost querulous . “ Why look you , mistress , ” he added , “ is it not bad for our trade for us to tarry so long at one place , ay , more especially when ' tis here in the East where the creeks are as unknown to us as to the excise men themselves ? ” “ Of a truth ' tis bad indeed , ” Mistress Pullen spoke with conviction . “ I wonder the Captain has it so , ” she remarked again glancing sideways at him . Blueneck looked into the fire for a moment before he spoke . “ Methinks the Captain is bewitched , ” he said at last . “ Bewitched ! ” Mistress Amy , her thoughts flying at once to her other visitor of the evening , spoke in some alarm . Blueneck shrugged his shoulders . “ Anyway , I never saw him so before	” he remarked , glancing under her curls , remarked - 're yellow , sat hands her fire in on , a none seora , sat hands her fire in on , sat hands her fire in on , sat hands her fire in on , sat hands her fire in on , sat hands her fire in on , sat hands her fire in on , sat hands her , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ , ” he added , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he added , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” he said , “ Blueneck , ” and he sat down on the fireside .
"satisfaction . """""""" Now for the power ! """""""" He ran down to the laboratory and threw in a switch . Then he threw in another one with his foot , while clasping his ears tightly with his rubber - gloved hands . A terrible , whining sound was heard , and the building shook . It was the warning siren on top of the house , which could be heard within a radius of sixty miles , sounding its warning to all to keep away from tall steel or metal structures , or , if they could not do this , to insulate themselves . He sounded the siren twice for ten seconds , which meant that he would direct his ultra - power for at least twenty minutes , and everybody must be on guard for this length of time . No sooner had the siren blast stopped , than he had seen Alice at the Telephot , signalling him that everything was in readiness . He yelled to her to insulate herself , and he saw her jump into a tall glass chair where she sat perfectly still , deathly white . He could see that she clasped her hands to her ears ; and he knew that she must be trying to shut out the thunder of the descending avalanche . He ran up his high glass ladder ; and having reached the top , began to turn the large glass wheel the shaft of which was connected with the ultra - generator . As he started turning the wheel , for the first time he looked at the clock . He observed that it was just nine minutes after he first had heard the gong and he smiled , coldly . He knew he was in time . A terrifying roar set in as soon as he had commenced to turn the wheel . It was as if a million devils had been let loose . Sparks were flying everywhere . Small metal parts not encased in lead boxes fused . Long streamers of blue flames emanated from sharp objects , while ball - shaped objects glowed with a white aureole . Large iron pieces became strongly magnetic , and small iron objects continually flew from one large iron piece to another . Ralph 's watch chain became so hot that he had to discard it , together with his watch . He kept on turning the wheel , and the roar changed to a scream so intense that he had to pull out his rubber ear vacuum - caps so that he might not hear the terrible sound . As he turned the wheel farther around the tone of the ultra - generator reached the note where it coincided with the fundamental note of the building , which was built of steelonium ( the new substitute for steel ) .

to the phone . He stood within hearing distance while she talked . He heard her say something like , ‘ Yes ... yes . Oh , God ! ' And he noticed she was upset when she hung up . She told him she felt sick . He tried to argue with her but she dashed out of the theater without changing her costume or taking the paint off her face . ” “ A revelation , ” murmured De Medici . His spirits seemed to have risen as the detective talked . Dr. Lytton sat with his lips pursed , dividing his attention between the two men . “ I knew you knew about the telephone call , ” Norton went on good - naturedly , “ and I do n't blame you for trying to shield the girl . ” “ Gallant , ” sighed De Medici . “ Thanks . Go on . ” “ Well , ” resumed Norton , “ we finally located the cabby who had driven her home . This took a few hours , but when we got him he remembered her well , owing to the fact she had her make - up and costume on and acted queer and excited . She got into his cab outside the theater and drove to the Ballau apartment , giving him a dollar tip in advance and telling him to go as fast as he could . Her contention at the inquest was that she reached the apartment about half - past ten . From the stage manager 's evidence and the cabby 's statement it is obvious that she got home about a quarter to ten the latest . If she 'd stopped at all between the telephone call and entering the cab she 'd have removed her make - up and taken her hat or a wrap of some kind . We know she did n't . Our investigations in the Ballau home resulted in finding a towel in the linen basket off Miss Ballau 's room . The towel was smeared with rouge and lampblack . We found out that the basket had been emptied that afternoon by the laundryman . Therefore the towel with the rouge and lampblack on it was placed there during that day . ” “ Your deductions are invulnerable , ” De Medici smiled . “ We 'll discuss them more fully later , ” Norton countered , his good humor remaining under the derision of his visitor . “ You do n't seem convinced that Miss Ballau is guilty ? ” He smiled in turn . De Medici shook his head . “ Despite his good humor , ” he thought , “ he 's uncertain of something . The theory has a hole in it .... Or he would n't be telling me . Or perhaps it 's another one of his brilliant ruses .... ” “ We 'll discuss them more	De Medici , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , he shook his head , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici Medici Medici , Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici , Medici Medici Medici , Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici Medici
his black eyebrows the big staring eyes seemed ready to jump out of his head . “ Aha ! ” he exclaimed ; and then , “ So I 've got you ! ” The hand that held the paper was trembling , and the other hand reached out like a great claw , and fastened itself in the neck of Peter 's coat , and drew it together until Peter was squeezed tight . “ You threw that bomb ! ” hissed the man . “ Wh - what ? ” gasped Peter , his voice almost fainting . “ B - b - bomb ? ” “ Out with it ! ” cried the man , and his face came close to Peter 's , his teeth gleaming as if he were going to bite off Peter 's nose . “ Out with it ! Quick ! Who helped you ? ” “ My G - God ! ” said Peter . “ I d - dunno what you mean . ” “ You dare lie to me ? ” roared the man ; and he shook Peter as if he meant to jar his teeth out . “ No nonsense now ! Who helped you make that bomb ? ” Peter 's voice rose to a scream of terror : “ I never saw no bomb ! I dunno what you 're talkin ' about ! ” “ You , come this way , ” said the man , and started suddenly toward the door . It might have been more convenient if he had turned Peter around , and got him by the back of his coat - collar ; but he evidently held Peter 's physical being as a thing too slight for consideration -- he just kept his grip in the bosom of Peter 's jacket , and half lifted him and half shoved him back out of the room , and down a long passage to the back part of the building . And all the time he was hissing into Peter 's face : “ I 'll have it out of you ! Do n't think you can lie to me ! Make up your mind to it , you 're going to come thru ! ” The man opened a door . It was some kind of storeroom , and he walked Peter inside and slammed the door behind him . “ Now , out with it ! ” he said . The man thrust into his pocket the printed circular , or whatever it was -- Peter never saw it again , and never found out what was printed on it . With his free hand the man grabbed one of Peter 's hands , or rather one finger of Peter 's hand , and bent it suddenly backward with terrible violence . “ Oh ! ” screamed Peter . “ Stop ! ” And then , with a wild	” he screamed , ” he cried , ” he screamed , ” he screamed , ” he screamed , ” he screamed , ” he screamed , ” he screamed , ” he screamed , ” he screamed , ” he sli , ” he , ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , “ ” he , ” he said , “ ” he shook his hands , “ ” he shook his head , “ ” he said , ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , ” he said , “ ” he screamed , ” he said , “ ” he screamed , ” he said , “ ” he screamed , “ , ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , ” he said , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , “ ” he screamed , ” he said , “ ” he screamed , “ , ” he screamed
, and De Medici caught a grateful glint in her eyes , “ I could n't go on with the play . I felt I 'd forget my lines and I asked the stage manager to let my understudy take my place . I came home . ” “ About ten - thirty , ” repeated the detective . Florence nodded . “ How did you get in ? ” he asked . “ I rang the bell several times and Jane finally answered it . ” “ What did she say to you ? ” “ Nothing . She 'd been busy in the kitchen . She went right back to her work . ” “ Did she know that anything had happened ? ” “ No . She seemed entirely calm and went back to the kitchen without saying anything . ” “ Was the door to the library closed ? ” “ Yes . ” “ There 's another door at the end of the hallway that shuts off the kitchen , is n't there ? ” “ There are two doors . The dining room 's between . ” “ So if the library door and the two other doors were closed things could happen in this room without anybody hearing ? ” Florence nodded . “ Then what did you do when you came into the house ? ” “ I came into the library and saw this , ” she answered . “ Thank you , Miss Ballau , ” Norton smiled at her . “ That will be all for the present . I suggest you lie down . ” To the man at the door he added , “ Call the housekeeper . ” Florence stood up and De Medici came to her side . His eyes had avoided her during the questioning . But he pressed her arm eagerly with his fingers now . The lieutenant was watching . He felt certain of this . So he could say nothing now . He felt her draw back as they came to the door , beyond which rose a babble of excited voices . “ If you please , Mr. De Medici , ” Norton 's voice called , “ will you remain while we examine the housekeeper ? ” “ I 'll be all right , ” she murmured close to him . He opened the door and watched her as she walked slowly and silently down the corridor . Jane , the housekeeper , entered and was motioned to the chair in which Florence had sat . “ What 's your name ? ” Lieutenant Norton asked . The woman 's eyes were reddened with crying . Her voice was indistinct . “ Jane Mayfield , ” she answered . “ How long have you worked for Mr. Ballau ? ” “ Ever since he 's been in New York — about fifteen years , I think . ” “	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
‘ Twill be full dawn at five . ” Then he turned to Hal . “ In four hours I 'll risk going out with him , lad , ” he said . “ Will you wait till then ? ” Hal nodded . Gilbot looked up . “ I had forgot , ” he said . “ I had forgot ; it is a long time since I went out on the mud -- ah , well ! Hal , bring me some rum . ” * * * * * The sky was a pale gray in which two or three late stars still shone faintly , and there was a sharp twang of frost in the air , when two men , carrying the body of a third between them , four great weights slung over their shoulders , stumbled out of the old Ship 's kitchen , leaving behind them a girl asleep by the empty grate and an old man lying drunk upstairs . As they came out into the yard they both turned instinctively to a patch of newly disturbed earth on their right from the side of which rose a dark figure , who glided off into the grayness beyond . The shorter of the two men spoke gruffly . “ The witch was fond enough of the lass , ” he said . “ I wonder she did n't do more to save her . ” The other answered him bitterly : “ It was n't her place , Joe . ' Twas mine . And I did naught . God knows I -- I thought she loved him , ” he added , giving the slim little figure whose shoulders he held a violent shake . Pullen shook his head , and a drop of pure sentiment crept into his bright blue eyes . “ ‘ Tis a wonderful pity , ” he said slowly , “ a wonderful pity -- poor little lass -- and him , too -- he must have loved her , or he 'd never have killed hisself . ” The memory of Nan 's upstretched arm and fierce blow came clearly to Hal , and he opened his mouth to speak , but thought better of it , and they trudged on in silence . The mud looked very black , cold , and sinister when they at last reached the shore ; the tide was well out , and the sea seemed a full mile the other side of the soft greenish belt . Joe dropped the Spaniard 's feet and stood staring in front of him for a moment ; then he stooped down and lifted them again . “ It 's a bit farther up , ” he said shortly , and they went on . Presently he stopped again . “ Here we are , ” he remarked , as he sat down on the shingle , and , taking off	, ” he remarked , “ ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , , a , a , a , a , , a , , a , , , a , , , a , 
"of his altar , hazard the wrath of an offended deity . Chapter 28 I ABANDON HOPE At last Milton and I arose and proceeded to examine carefully this chamber of carven horrors . By the altar , another passage was discovered . Like the great chamber itself and the passage by which we had entered , this tunnel had been hewn out of the living rock by the hand of man . It was some sixty feet in length and conducted us into a small but most remarkable grotto , or rather a series of grottoes . We advanced , however , but a little way there ; a few minutes , and we were again in the hall of the dragon . We continued , and finished , our examination of the place . Another passage was discovered , in the roof and leading , of course , to we knew not where . Then there were those stone horrors ranged along either wall ; but I shall not attempt to describe those nightmare - monstrosities , some of which , by the way , had two heads.[10 ] [ Footnote 10 : """""""" The Chevalier d'Angos , a learned astronomer , carefully observed , for several days , a lizard with two heads , and assured himself that this lizard had two wills independent of each other , and possessing nearly equal power over the body , which was in one .

without an automobile . Peter reflected as he walked that if he continued to move in these higher circles , he too would have to join the motor - driving class . About the estate there ran a great bronze fence , ten feet high , with sharp , inhospitable spikes pointing outwards . Peter had read about this fence a long time ago in the American City “ Times ” ; it was so and so many thousand yards long , and had so and so many spikes , and had cost so and so many tens of thousands of dollars . There were big bronze gates locked tight , and a sign that said : “ Beware the dogs ! ” Inside the gates were three guards carrying rifles and walking up and down ; they were a consequence of the recent dynamite conspiracy , but Peter did not realize this , he took them for a regular institution , and a symbol of the importance of the man he was to visit . He pressed a button by the side of the gate , and a lodgekeeper came out , and Peter , according to orders , gave the name “ Arthur G. McGillicuddy . ” The lodge - keeper went inside and telephoned , and then came back and opened the gate , just enough to admit Peter . “ You 're to be searched , ” said the lodge - keeper ; and Peter , who had been arrested many times , took no offense at this procedure , but found it one more evidence of the importance of Nelse Ackerman . The guards went thru his pockets , and felt him all over , and then one of them marched him up the long gravel avenue thru the forest , climbed a flight of marble steps to the palace on the knoll , and turned him over to a Chinese butler who walked on padded slippers . If Peter had not known that this was a private home he would have thought it was an art gallery . There were great marble columns , and paintings bigger than Peter , and tapestries with life - size horses ; there were men in armor , and battle axes and Japanese dancing devils , and many other strange sights . Ordinarily Peter would have been interested in learning how a great millionaire decorated his house , and would have drunk deep of the joy of being amid such luxury . But now all his thoughts were taken up with his dangerous business . Nell had told him what to look for , and he looked . Mounting the velvet - carpeted staircase , he noted a curtain behind which a man might hide , and a painting of a Spanish cavalier on the wall just opposite . He would make use of these two sights .

When the sun rose , he found some shelter among the rocks , where he might defend himself if attacked . He expected that the Jacarillos would trail him as soon as it was light enough to see tracks , and that with ponies or donkeys they might well be on him before noon . In this he was unjust to the Jacarillos : they did not trail those whom they judged to be already doomed . In his shelter he ate , drank and then slept ; he did not wake until the setting sun shone through a crevice among the rocks on to his face . After eating and drinking he set out again into the Sierras . All littleness was gone from the mountains now . His world was one with the elements , the sky , great stars , and gigantic crags , silent except when now and then there came a roar from something breaking in the glacier , or the thunder of a boulder falling . The moon rose to light his going up a slope of rock , which seemed curtained by other slopes of rock . Here he laid down one of the revolvers which he had taken from Pappa Peppy . He laid it on the rock beside him . Instantly it slithered down , gathering small stones as it went , till it was thundering down the rocky slope far , far below , with an avalanche about it . He saw it flash and presently heard a report , and realised , as he had not realised before , that he might have slipped like the gun and gone gliddering down among the boulders in the same way . At about midnight he reached a ledge of rock ,	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and calves , she was considered much too thin for beauty , let alone for tights . It had been this Magnolia Ravenal 's respiratory lack that had saved the new - born girl from being cursed through life with a name boasting more quadruple vowels and consonants than any other in the language . She had meant to call the child Mississippi after the tawny untamed river on which she had spent so much of her girlhood , and which had stirred and fascinated her always . Her accouchement had been an ordeal even more terrifying than is ordinarily the case , for Kim Ravenal had actually been born on the raging turgid bosom of the Mississippi River itself , when that rampageous stream was flooding its banks and inundating towns for miles around , at five o'clock of a storm - racked April morning in 1889 . It was at a point just below Cairo , Illinois ; that region known as Little Egypt , where the yellow waters of the Mississippi and the olive - green waters of the Ohio so disdainfully meet and refuse , with bull - necked pride , to mingle . From her cabin window on the second deck of the Cotton Blossom Floating Palace Theatre , Magnolia Ravenal could have seen the misty shores of three states — if any earthly shores had interested her at the moment . Just here was Illinois , to whose crumbling clay banks the show boat was so perilously pinioned . Beyond , almost hidden by the rain veil , was Missouri ; and there , Kentucky . But Magnolia Ravenal lay with her eyes shut because the effort of lifting her lids was beyond her . Seeing her , you would have said that if any shores filled her vision at the moment they were heavenly ones , and those dangerously near . So white , so limp , so spent was she that her face on the pillow was startlingly like one of the waxen blossoms whose name she bore . Her slimness made almost no outline beneath the bedclothes . The coverlet was drawn up to her chin . There was only the white flower on the pillow , its petals closed . Outside , the redundant rain added its unwelcome measure to the swollen and angry stream . In the ghostly gray dawn the grotesque wreckage of flood - time floated and whirled and jiggled by , seeming to bob a mad obeisance as it passed the show boat which , in its turn , made stately bows from its moorings . There drifted past , in fantastic parade , great trees , uprooted and clutching at the water with stiff dead arms ; logs , catapulted with terrific force ; animal carcasses dreadful in their passivity ; chicken coops ; rafts ; a piano , its ivory mouth fixed in a death grin ; a two - room cabin , upright

Typewriters soon disappeared after its invention . Nor was there any use for stenographers , as the thoughts were written down direct on the tape , which was sent out as a letter was sent centuries ago . As was his custom in the evening he worked for some hours in the laboratory , and retired at midnight . Before he fell asleep he attached to his head a double leather head - band with metal temple plates , similar to the one used in connection with the Menograph . He then called for his man , Peter , and told him to """""""" put on """""""" Homer 's _ Odyssey _ for the night .

Peter returning to Ralph 's bedroom placed the reel containing the film in a rack and introduced the end of the film into the _ Hypnobioscope _ .

It remained to Ralph , however , to perfect the Hypnobioscope , which transmitted words direct to the sleeping brain , in such a manner that everything could be remembered in detail the next morning . This was made possible by having the impulses _ act directly and steadily on the brain _ . In other words , it was the Menograph reversed , with certain additions .

' at _ so ! ” drawled the amused voice , with an element of surprise in it now . “ Is _ ' at _ so ! ” Ravenal cast Kentucky Sue from him . “ Well , if you will have it , ” he threatened , grimly . He sprang over the footlights , down to the piano top , to the keyboard , to the piano stool , all in four swift strides , was up the aisle , had plucked the limp and sprawling figure out of his seat by the collar , clutched him then firmly by this collar hold and the seat of his pants , and was up the aisle again to the doorway , out of the door , across the gangplank , and into the darkness . He was down the aisle then in a moment , spatting his hands briskly as he came ; was up on the piano stool , on to the piano keyboard , on the piano top , over the footlights , back in position . There he paused a moment , breathing fast . Nothing had been said . There had actually been no sound other than his footsteps and the discordant jangle of protest that the piano keyboard had emitted when he had stepped on its fingers . Now a little startled expression came into Ravenal 's face . “ Let 's see , ” he said , aloud . “ Where was I — — ” And as one man the audience chanted , happily , “ Sue , ef he loves yuh and you love him — — ” What weapon has a Parthenia against a man like that ? And what chance a Frank ? Drama leaped to him . There was , less than a week later , the incident of the minister . He happened to be a rather dirty little minister in a forlorn little Kentucky river town . He ran a second - hand store on the side , was new to the region , and all unaware of the popularity and good - will enjoyed by the members of the _ Cotton Blossom _ troupe . To him an actor was a burning brand . Doc had placarded the little town with dodgers and handbills . There was one , especially effective even in that day of crude photography , showing Magnolia in the angelic part of the ingénue lead in Tempest and Sunshine . These might be seen displayed in the windows of such ramshackle stores as the town 's river - front street boasted . Gaylord Ravenal , strolling disdainfully up into the sordid village that was little more than a welter of mud and flies and mules and Negroes , stopped aghast as his eye chanced to fall upon the words scrawled beneath a picture of Magnolia amidst the dusty disorderly mélange of the ministerial second - hand window .

and old , and subsided . Blueneck came a little nearer . “ Might I ask what you are talking about ? ” he said . Cip de Musset rolled his quid into his cheek and spat before he replied . “ A rowboat load o ' rum and two men lost going from here to Bradwell , ” he said laconically . “ Ah , ” said Granger , “ wonderful strange . ” “ What , ai n't the boat been washed up ? ” said Blueneck , glad to enter into the conversation . “ No , nothing found at all , ” said Granger eagerly , as he shifted his position slightly . “ Nothing at all . But , ah , well , ” he added , “ I do n't know what 's come to them . ” “ Would the Preventative men have catched them , think you ? ” remarked Cip , chewing . “ Now that are likely , ” said Granger sarcastically . “ Ai n't ' it ? There not being a sign of a Preventative man these nine months ! Oh , yes , Master de Musset , it are likely they 'd be spry enough to catch two chaps in a rowboat in the middle of the Blackwater without a soul on the Island or the mainland knowing aught . Lord , you ought to ha ' been an excise man yourself , you ought . ” “ Maybe , Granger , maybe , ” said Cip de Musset placidly and without ceasing to chew . “ Maybe they drank the liquor and then pulled out the bung and sunk her theirselves , ” suggested Habakkuk , sniffing violently . Granger turned slowly in his seat and let his gaze fall upon the nervous little man for a second or two before he spoke . “ Ah ! Master Rheum - in - the - head , maybe they did , ” he said , “ and maybe the devil come along and carried them off in a thunder - cloud , or maybe a sea - serpent swallowed them . Eh ? ” Habakkuk looked into the others ' unsmiling faces and sniffed , while a weak , ineffectual little smile spread over his bilious , pimply face , and then , as Granger betrayed no amusement , it struck him that he must have said something sensible , so he answered , “ Ay , most likely , ” wagging his head sagely . The company burst into a roar of laughter , and Habakkuk , feeling that this time he had been witty , joined with them happily . “ Ah , no , but it is unnatural , ” continued Granger thoughtfully after the laughter had subsided . “ And ye know it ai n't the first time a rowboat o ' rum and two chaps have been lost , ” he went	” “ Ah , ” he remarked , “ oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , ” he said , “ Ah , ” he sarcastically , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” ” he said , “ ” he said , “ ” ” he said , “ maybe ” he , “ ” he said , “ maybe ” he sarcastically , “ maybe n't , ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe n't know , ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said , “ maybe ” he said .
and his confederates , in a deserted house , at the far end of the military road , right hand side after the second cross - roads . ” “ I can see the shanty from here , ” announced the sergeant , “ a wretched hovel it is ; but who is it tells us ... ? ” Tom Bob informed him curtly : “ _ I _ tell you , that is sufficient ! ... how many men have you ? ” “ Eight . ” “ That 's not enough . ” The sergeant was getting alarmed : “ I can ask for more from the Charenton office ! ” “ That 's the thing . ” The sergeant got into communication by telephone with his colleague at the neighbouring police post . “ There are fifteen over yonder , ” he informed Tom Bob . “ They must all come , ” declared the detective , “ Fantômas ' band counts at least a round dozen ruffians . ” The detective 's requirements were transmitted from the Alfort office , and the fifteen Charenton officers promised to be there in a quarter of an hour . The gallant sergeant was greatly excited by the coming events ; to avoid all doubt and make sure he was covered by his superiors , he asked : “ Monsieur Bob , shall you be coming with us ? ” “ Undoubtedly ! ” replied the American detective . But the sergeant was not satisfied yet . “ I have a great mind , ” he announced , “ to go and inform the Commissary , he lives close by . ” “ You should have done that long ago ! ” Tom Bob said rebukingly . Then , while the sergeant was issuing his orders , the detective sat down in the public office , lit a cigarette , and did not vouchsafe another word . * * * * * Before coming thus rudely to disturb the peace and quietness of the Alfort Commissariat , Tom Bob had been wandering up and down most part of the night in perplexity . On quitting the Palais de Justice , leaving Fuselier to make the best of his absurd plight , that ambiguous individual had realized one fact quite clearly , viz . , that the magistrate had looked at him in a way that was decidedly disquieting . An extraordinary thing for him , Tom Bob 's face had blanched somewhat under the magistrate 's questioning look , but he quickly recovered his customary coolness . Stepping out on to the Boulevard du Palais , quite empty and deserted at this late hour , he hailed a passing taxi and offered the driver a handsome tip to drive him as far as the first houses of Alfort . There the detective quitted his conveyance and plunged into the darkness of the silent lanes of the sleeping village .

A stroke ! ' And then a crash . ” Magnolia was surprised to find herself weeping : not for grief ; in almost unwilling admiration of this powerful mind and will that had recognized the Enemy even as he stole up on her and struck the blow from behind . “ There , there ! ” cooed Elly Chipley , pleased that her recital had at last moved this handsome silent woman to proper tears . “ There , there ! ” She patted her hand . “ Look , Nollie dear . There 's the boat . Seems funny not to see her lighted up for the show this time of night . ” Magnolia peered through the dusk , a kind of dread in her heart . Would this , too , be changed beyond recognition ? A great white long craft docked at the water 's edge . Larger , yes . But much the same .

Anny sat down again . “ I owe you a kiss , Hal , ” she said softly , twisting her fingers together as they lay on her lap . “ Well ? ” Hal 's tone was still gruff . “ You owe me a kiss , Hal , ” she said without looking at him . “ Well ? ” the boy drew crosses and rings round the side of the slate . Anny sighed . “ You were adding the reckonings , Hal , and I want to pay mine , ” she said . “ I 'm sorry I doubted thee , Anny , but the Spaniard is so fine , ” said Hal , a moment or two later , all debts having been squared . Anny laughed happily . “ ‘ Tis not you but Big French who should be afeared of the Spaniard , ” she said , looking over toward Sue , who was still staring through the open door . As though aware that she was being spoken of the girl turned round . “ Anny , lass , ” she called . “ Come , I would talk to thee . ” Anny rose . “ Foolish one , ” she whispered to Hal as her lips brushed his ear . Hal watched her go lightly across the room and then returned to his reckoning much comforted , but he reflected as he worked that whether she had paid him back or not Anny Farren had certainly forgotten to kiss him on the night that Dick Delfazio , the Spaniard , first came to the Ship Inn . Meanwhile , Sue and Anny stood together in the doorway deep in talk . “ But , Anny , ” Sue was saying , as she held out the skirt of her gown for the other 's inspection , “ think you ' twill serve another winter ? ” Anny looked at it for a moment ; then she displayed her own . “ ‘ Tis much better than mine , Mistress Sue , ” she said . “ Oh ! but you need not look so neat as I , ” Sue spoke quickly and without thinking . But , seeing the other girl 's lip tremble , she put an arm round her slim shoulders . “ Nay , I did not mean to speak so , ” she said kindly . “ I was thinking but of myself ; see , lass , when Master French next goes to Tiptree he shall bring me a new length of flannel from the market , and I will give thee this gown , for , truly , thine is very old . ” Anny looked up	” Sue sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat in the room .

How I should like to take you in my arms . ) “ Oh , I 've never even seen Chicago . Only these river towns . ” ( I love the way your hair grows away from your temples in that clean line . I want to put my finger on it , and stroke it . My dear . ) “ A sordid kind of city . Crude . Though it has some pleasant aspects . New York — — ” ( What do I care if that old tabby is sitting there ! What 's to prevent me from getting up and kissing you a long long while on your lovely pomegranate mouth . ) Lowering , inflexible , sat Parthy . “ She 'll soon enough tire of that sort of popinjay talk , ” she told herself . She saw the bland and almost vacuous expression on the countenance of the young man , and being ignorant of the fact that he was famous from St. Louis to Chicago for his perfect poker face , was equally ignorant of the tides that were seething and roaring within him now . They were prisoners on this boat ; together , yet miles apart . Guarded , watched . They had their scenes together on the stage . These were only aggravations . The rather high planes of Magnolia 's cheek - bones began to show a trifle too flat . Ravenal , as he walked along the grass - grown dusty streets of this or that little river town , switched viciously at weed and flower stalks with the slim malacca cane . They hit upon a pathetic little scheme whereby they might occasionally , if lucky , steal the ecstasy of a good - night kiss . After the performance he would stroll carelessly out to the stern where stood the settling barrel . Ostensibly he was taking a bedtime drink of water . Magnolia was , if possible , to meet him there for a brief and perilous moment . It was rarely accomplished . The signal to him was the slamming of the screen door . But often the screen door slammed as he stood there , a tense quivering figure in the velvet dark of the Southern night , and it was Frank , or Mrs. Soaper , or Mis ' Means , or puny Mr. Means , coughing his bronchial wheeze . Crack ! went the screen door . Disappointment . Often he sloshed down whole gallons of river water before she came — if she came at all . He had managed to save almost a hundred dollars .

He recounted the incident to James , who agreed with him that in all likelihood his suspicions were correct , and the two men parted for the day , the older bearing with him the comforting reassurance that Ralph would take care of his daughter as he would himself .

had been my idea that as I could paddle faster than he could row , I could soon reach him . My plan was to let him go ashore , and then as he stepped out of the boat , to reach his side . One thing above all I wished to do — see who it might be . After that there were a few questions I wished to ask . But either I misjudged the distance he was ahead of me or else he could row far better than I expected . In my haste I had paddled straight out into the lake , forgetting for a moment or so that the shore took a wide curve . When I remembered that , it was to discover the man had rowed straight across this half circle , and I had to turn to the shore . This gave him several extra minutes , and though , when he ran his boat up on the shore , I was only a few feet away , yet it gave the time he needed . He must have discovered just before he beached his boat that I was behind him . In fact I was so close that when he rose and jumped to the shore , I could partly see his figure — an indistinct mass in the darkness . He half turned , jumped from his boat , partly stumbled , only to gather himself and run away in the darkness . The next second my canoe crashed on the beach , half throwing me to my knees . Jumping from it , I set out in the direction the man had taken . We were on some one 's lawn , for I saw the figure darting ahead of me , thrown into reflection for a moment by the lights of a house . Then it went through a hedge and was lost to sight . I ran over the grass , through the opening in the hedge , and then discovered that I was on Carter 's land . As I glimpsed the running figure ahead , I heard Trouble , who was locked in the garage , give a sudden bark , and then commence to bark incessantly . I wished with all my heart the dog was loose , but there was not time to open the garage door . When I ran around the front of Carter 's house , the man was not in sight . In front of me was another hedge , to my left the lake , and to my right the lawn ran to the street . In this direction the street lights made it possible to see that there was no one there . Deciding the man had gone through the hedge , I ran down the path , and the next second was on the lawn which belonged to the minister .

in such chunks of scarlet fragrance as made the nectar and ambrosia of the gods seem poor , flavourless fare indeed . Magnolia , when luck was high , tried to put a little money by as she had instinctively been prompted to do during those first months of their marriage , when they still were on the _ Cotton Blossom _ . But she rarely had money of her own . Gay , when he had ready cash , was generous — but not with the handing over of the actual coin itself . “ Buy yourself some decent clothes , Nola ; and the kid . Tell them to send me the bill . That thing you 're wearing is a terrible sight . It seems to me you have n't worn anything else for months . ” Which was true enough . There was something fantastic about the magnificence with which he ignored the reason for her not having worn anything else for months . It had been , certainly , her one decent garment during the lean period just passed , and she had cleaned and darned and refurbished to keep it so . Her experience in sewing during the old _ Cotton Blossom _ days stood her in good stead now . There were times when even the Ontario Street hotel took on the aspect of unattainable luxury . That meant rock bottom . Then it was that the Ravenals took a room at three dollars a week in a frowzy rooming house on Ohio or Indiana or Erie ; the Bloomsbury of Chicago . There you saw unshaven men , their coat collars turned up in artless attempt to conceal the absence of linen , sallying forth , pail in hand , at ten or eleven in the morning in search of the matutinal milk and rolls to accompany the coffee that was even now cooking over the gas jet . Morning was a musty jade on these streets ; nothing fresh and dewy and sparkling about her . The ladies of the neighbourhood lolled huge , unwieldy , flaccid , in wrappers . In the afternoon you saw them amazingly transformed into plump and pinkly powdered persons , snugly corseted , high - heeled , rustling in silk petticoats , giving out a heady scent . They were friendly voluble ladies who beamed on the pale slim Magnolia , and said , “ Wo n't you smile for me just a little bit ? H'm ? ” to the sedate and solemn - eyed Kim . Magnolia , too , boiled coffee and eggs over the gas jet in these lean times . Gravely she counted out the two nickels that would bring her and Kim home from Lincoln Park on the street car .

anything like then . He lapsed into sleep again . In his usual health , he would have been up and out striding on foot to Las Palomas , without waiting for any shift - train , but he was only the wreck of himself , all weak and weary . Perhaps a salvo of guns , a blast of trumpets , or the noise of all three masts going over the side , would have failed to rouse him then . He slept , as sailors say , “ dead - oh . ” He would not have wakened for less than a kick in the face . Presently , however , he roused again at the battering clank of a train of trucks backing in upon the truck in which he was lying . He roused enough to hear voices and the clank of chain , with the thought that they were doing something with a steam winch , he could not care what . He drowsed off at once into the deeps of sleep into which none but harvesters and sailors ever sink . In his sleep , he became conscious of vibration , as though he were in a berth above the engines in some small steamer under way . It was soothing , or at least not unpleasant , to his mood of feverish drowsiness , to be shaken thus , perhaps he slept the better for it . For some hours he slept . Gradually , as he came to himself , he found himself listening in his sleep for the bell , so that he might know how much of his watch remained to him . The bell did not strike , though he hearkened after it . He felt cold , and was aware that sprays were hitting the side of the deck - housecontinually . Then , punctually at the “ one bell , ” at the moment at which he would have been called , he roused up wide awake with the knowledge that something was very wrong indeed . He was accustomed to turning out and being on deck within a minute . He roused up now with one heave , weak , stiff and aching as he was , ready for action . He came to himself , remembering all the events of the night before , and at once took stock of things . He was in the truck , which was jolting along a bad line at about fifteen miles an hour . It was daylight , yet all dim with storm . The hitting on the truck which he had taken to be sprays on the deckhouse was sand , pelting in from the desert . The floor of the truck was covered with a fine layer of sand . A pelt of sand flew over the side of the car continually .

Santa Barbara , “ to complete with sugar for home . ” During the day , while bending sails aloft , he had seen the white walls of Los Xicales and had been struck by their likeness to a house in England , near the sea , where he had stayed as a child . He had taken a good look at the place , while waiting for the sail to come up to him , with the thought that it was either a coastguard station or a lighthouse . After that , work occupied him until dusk , so that he put the house out of his mind . For some weeks he had been training himself to be “ a hard case , ” that is , able to stand exposure , by sleeping on the top of the deckhouse , between the mizen staysail and one of the boats . Here , with one blanket between himself and the deck , one blanket over him , and a coil of boat 's falls for a pillow , he went to bed that night as usual , thinking the thoughts which meant much to him . These thoughts were not about the house , but about a girl , whose idea filled his inner life intensely . He had thought his thoughts of this girl , as he always did , when putting the day from him , and had then turned over , to sleep as usual . He saw the stars overhead , through a maze of the main - rigging : he heard the water go crooning and gurgling by , and a man in the deckhouse beneath him knock out his pipe ; then instantly he was asleep , in a sea - sleep , a depth of sleep , a million miles from this world . Out of his sleep he started up , an hour before dawn , with that mansion by the sea lit up in his brain and words ringing like prophecy in his ears : “ You will meet her again in that house , for the second of the three times . It will be very , very important , so be ready . ” He had risen up in the cold and dew of before dawn to stare towards the house , almost expecting to see it lit with angels ; but it lay among its trees , barely visible . The dew was dripping , the water crooning and the watchman humming a song between his teeth . The cook was up making coffee , for there was a light in the galley ; everything was as usual , except himself . He was so shaken with excitement that he gripped the mizen stay to keep himself from leaping overboard to swim to that lone beach . Then caution had come back upon him , with the thought , “ It will not be to -	Während es während der zweiten Sekunde leuchtete , hielt es sich intensiv auf und hielt die Segel , so daß es während der zweiten Sekunde leuchtete , so daß es während der zweiten Sekunde leuchtete , so daß es während der zweiten Sekunde leuchtete .

Out when tender , the jacket removed ; into the oven with it . Basting and basting from Queenie 's long - handled spoon . The long sharp knife again for cutting , and then the slices , juicy and scented , with the stuffing of spices making a mosaic pattern against the pink of the meat . Many years later Kim Ravenal , the actress , would serve at the famous little Sunday night suppers that she and her husband Kenneth Cameron were so fond of giving a dish that she called ham _ à la _ Queenie . “ How does your cook do it ! ” her friends would say — Ethel Barrymore or Kit Cornell or Frank Crowninshield or Charley Towne or Woollcott . “ I 'll bet it is n't real at all . It 's painted on the platter . ” “ It is not ! It 's a practical ham , stuffed with all kinds of devilment . The recipe is my mother 's . She got it from an old Southern cook named Queenie . ” “ Listen , Kim . You 're among friends . Your dear public is not present . You do n't have to pretend any old Southern aristocracy Virginia belle mammy stuff with _ us _ . ” “ Pretend , you great oaf ! I was born on a show boat on the Mississippi , and proud of it . Everybody knows that . ” Mrs. Hawks , bustling into the show - boat kitchen with her unerring gift for scenting an atmosphere of mellow enjoyment , and dissipating it , would find Magnolia perched on a chair , both elbows on the table , her palms propping her chin as she regarded with round - eyed fascination Queenie 's magic manipulations . Or perhaps Jo , the charming and shiftless , would be singing for her one of the Negro plantation songs , wistful with longing and pain ; the folk songs of a wronged race , later to come into a blaze of popularity as spirituals . For some nautical reason , a broad beam , about six inches high and correspondingly wide , stretched across the kitchen floor from side to side , dividing the room . Through long use Jo and Queenie had become accustomed to stepping over this obstruction , Queenie ponderously , Jo with an effortless swing of his lank legs . On this Magnolia used to sit , her arms hugging her knees , her great eyes in the little sallow pointed face fixed attentively on Jo . The kitchen was very clean and shining and stuffy .

What does he mean , Mom ? ” “ Hush ! ” hissed Parthy , and jerked the child 's arm . “ How 's that ? ” asked Andy , but he knew . “ Miscegenation . Case of a Negro woman married to a white man . Criminal offense in this state , as you well know . ” “ No such thing , ” shouted Andy . “ No such thing on board this boat . ” Sheriff Ike Keener produced a piece of paper . “ Name of the white man is Steve Baker . Name of the negress”—he squinted again at the slip of paper—“name of the negress is Julie Dozier . ” He looked around at the group . “ Which one 's them ? ” “ Oh , my God ! ” screamed Elly . “ Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! ” “ Shut up , ” said Schultzy , roughly . Steve stepped to the window and threw up the shade , letting the morning light into the crowded disorderly little cubicle . On the bed lay Julie , her eyes enormous in her sallow pinched face . “ I 'm Steve Baker . This is my wife . ” Sheriff Ike Keener tucked the paper in his pocket . “ You two better dress and come along with me . ” Julie stood up . She looked an old woman . The marmoset whimpered and whined in his fur nest . She put out a hand , automatically , and plucked it from the muff and held it in the warm hollow of her breast .	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

But “ Beauty Boy ” returned to his charge : “ Come now , do n't be a mean cuss , hand me over four bulls , wo n't you ? ” At last Père Moche so far yielded to the other 's eager importunities and forked out . But , like a good business man , he struck a bargain with the borrower that the latter , on his return , that is to say on the next day but one , should pay him back thirty francs . The cash once in his pocket , the apache vanished . Fandor had overheard it all , besides catching other scraps of conversation from one and another of the band , from which he gathered only one thing clearly , and that was that at bottom everyone of them was upset about the arrival of the redoubtable and mysterious Tom Bob , whose coming was announced with such a flourish of trumpets and noisy advertisement — a proceeding by - the - by he , Fandor , deemed highly injudicious . The journalist noted the “ Beauty Boy 's ” departure , and he could not help thinking that it would be greatly to _ his _ advantage , too , if only he could get to Hâvre . But alas ! he had not a sou and could not borrow from Père Moche , as the apache had done , inasmuch as he could not very well urge the same reasons to justify the loan . Still the idea tormented him that he _ must _ go to Hâvre . It was all important for him to get to know Tom Bob at the earliest possible moment , so to say before everybody else . He was still cudgelling his brains to discover some way of realizing his project when suddenly he shuddered to hear a hoarse , angry voice growling in his ear : “ Scoundrel , brigand , murderer , are n't you ashamed to show your face ? why do n't I have you run in on the spot ? will you rid me of the sight of you , now , this instant , you hell - hound of calamity ! ” Fandor wheeled round in consternation , dumbfounded by this avalanche of abuse , this maelstrom of words . His eyes opened wide in amazement ; it was old Moche who was addressing him in these furious terms — Moche , his face working with passion , unable to contain himself for anger . The old scoundrel went on with a hypocritical assumption of righteous indignation . “ When I think how I befriended you , how I saved you in your extremity , and then you came and murdered	Fandor mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mutterte , er mâvre .

was at fault . The American detective Tom Bob was in the same predicament . In fact , the latter , despite his fine audacity and his first triumphs , had not continued his successes . For quite a long time now people had ceased to talk about him ; he seemed to have lost interest in the war he had declared against Fantômas . Furthermore Fandor had observed that the American , who on his first arrival had promised him his protection and support , had suddenly left off seeing him , indeed made little or no concealment of the fact that he no longer desired to be in touch with him . Why this change ? with what object in view ? Was Tom Bob ashamed to avow himself beaten ? or was he hoping , alone , by himself , to run Fantômas to earth ? Such were the young man 's thoughts when the landlord of _ The Orange Blossom _ suddenly burst into the eating room . “ Daniel , ” he cried , “ you must make haste , my lad ! here 's the wedding party coming , they 're not late after all ; quick , put on your apron and jacket , breakfast will be served instanter ! ” Two landaus had just drawn up at the entrance to the gardens , two simple , unpretending vehicles , with none of your wide plate - glass windows , none of your big carriage lamps at the four corners of the coach . CHAPTER XXIII THE WEDDING BREAKFAST As Ascott desired the wedding was carried out in the strictest privacy . The party reached the _ Mairie _ at an early hour . Ascott had for witnesses his man servant John , and a casual secretary from the Consulate , bound over to the closest secrecy . Moreover , the young man in question , a person of much discretion who saw how things were with half an eye , had vanished immediately after the ceremony , saying he did not care to attend the breakfast , understanding in fact that his absence would not be taken in ill part , but very much the reverse . Nini Guinon 's witnesses were her uncle , Père Moche , recruited again for the purpose , and the vagabond Bouzille , who had been fetched from a drinking shop at Ménilmontant , and dressed up for the occasion in a second - hand frock coat . The formalities at the _ Mairie _ were quickly completed , the party adjourned to hear a mass at the nearest church , and then set off for the Bois de Vincennes . The last act of the grotesque adventure , the wedding breakfast , remained to be staged . Ascott , to Mme . Guinon 's bitter chagrin , had emphatically refused to make her acquaintance , thereby making the good woman desperately unhappy .

all with McCormick in jail ; and then , after her experience with Bob Ogden , Miriam had to go to a hospital , and of course Peter did n't want to fool with an invalid . He made himself agreeable to others of the Red girls , and they seemed to like him ; they treated him as a good comrade , but somehow they did not seem to act up to McGivney 's theories of “ free love . ” So Peter made up his mind that he would find him a girl who was not a Red . It would give him a little relief now and then , a little fun . The Reds seldom had any fun -- their idea of an adventure was to get off in a room by themselves and sing the International or the Red Flag in whispers , so the police could n't hear them . It was Saturday afternoon , and Peter went to a clothing store kept by a Socialist , and bought himself a new hat and a new suit of clothes on credit . Then he went out on the street , and saw a neat little girl going into a picture - show , and followed her , and they struck up an acquaintance and had supper together . She was what Peter called a “ swell dresser , ” and it transpired that she worked in a manicure parlor . Her idea of fun corresponded to Peter 's , and Peter spent all the money he had that Saturday evening , and made up his mind that if he could get something new on the Reds in the course of the week , he would strike McGivney for forty dollars . Next morning was Easter Sunday , and Peter met his manicurist by appointment , and they went for a stroll on Park Avenue , which was the aristocratic street of American City and the scene of the “ Easter parade . ” It was war time , and many of the houses had flags out , and many of the men were in uniform , and all of the sermons dealt with martial themes . Christ , it appeared , was risen again to make the world safe for democracy , and to establish self - determination for all people ; and Peter and Miss Frisbie both had on their best clothes , and watched the crowds in the “ Easter parade , ” and Miss Frisbie studied the costumes and make - up of the ladies , and picked up scraps of their conversation and whispered them to Peter , and made Peter feel that he was back on Mount Olympus again .

get a chance to drive — oh , well — ” at an objection from Andy—“sometimes ; but what kind of horses do they have in those little towns ! And here you can get a splendid pair , all shiny , and their nostrils working , and a victoria and lovely long tails and a clanky harness and fawn cushions and the lake and soft - shell crabs — — ” She was becoming incoherent , but remained as lovely as ever , and grew more appealing by the moment . Ravenal resisted a mad urge to take her in his arms . He addressed himself earnestly to the agonized Andy . “ If you will trust me , Captain Hawks , I have a plan which I have just thought of . I know New Orleans very well and I am — uh — very well known in New Orleans . Miss Magnolia has set her heart on this little holiday . I know where I can get a splendid turnout .

The stacks and piles still lay uncounted on the desk . This thing must be settled somehow . He scuttled to the window , scanned the wharf , the streets that led up from it . “ I do n't know where she 's got to . ” He turned from the window to survey the pair , helplessly . Something about them — the very fitness of their standing there together , so young , so beautiful , so eager , so alive , so vibrant — melted the romantic heart within him .

How like a man — to take it out on the horses just because he 's angry . ” She slipped her hand through his arm . “ Do n't ! Do n't jerk my arm like that . You 'll have them running away in a minute . ” “ I should think they would , after the way you slashed them . Sometimes I think you do n't care about horses — as horses — any more than you do about — — ” She stopped , aghast . She had almost said , “ than you do about me as a wife . ” A long breath . Then , “ Gay darling , I 'd like to go back on the stage . I 'd like to act again . Here , I mean . In Chicago . ” She was braced for a storm and could have weathered it . But his shouts of laughter startled and bewildered her and the sensitive chestnuts as well . At this final affront they bolted , and for the next fifteen minutes Magnolia clutched the little iron rod at the end of the seat with one hand and clung to her hat with the other as the outraged horses stretched their length down the rutty country road , eyes flaming , nostrils distended , hoofs clattering , the light high cart rocking and leaping behind them . Ravenal 's slender weight was braced against the footboard . The veins in his wrists shone blue against dead white . With a tearing sound his right sleeve ripped from his coat . Little beads of moisture stood out about his mouth and chin . Magnolia , white - lipped , tense , and terribly frightened , magnificently uttered no sound . If she had been one of your screamers there probably would have been a sad end . Slowly , gradually , the chestnuts slowed a trifle , slackened , resumed a normal pace , stood panting as Ravenal drew up at the side of the road . They actually essayed to nibble innocently at some sprigs of grass growing by the roadside while Ravenal wiped his face and neck and hands , slowly , with his fine perfumed linen handkerchief . He took off his black derby hat and mopped his forehead and the headband of his hat 's splendid white satin lining . He fell to swearing , softly , this being the form in which the male , relieved after fright , tries to deny that he has been frightened . He turned to look at her , his eyes narrow .

her God . The coming of the midnight seemed to be a signal that the life of the town should stop . It seemed to bring everybody home , so that in a few minutes the Plaza was almost empty and so quiet that one could tell the passing feet : the small , belated woman hurrying : the guardians in couples slowly patrolling , pausing to try if doors were locked . Then , from one of the streets leading to the Plaza from the northward , there came the singing of drunkards . Sard hoped at first , from the noise that was made , that the drunkards were foreigners ; but they were two English reefers , both sillily drunk , followed by a third , who , being sober and much younger than the others , was trying to pilot the drunkards down to the landing - stage . They were trying to sing some fragment of grand opera which they had heard that night : they made a bestial row , “ between the bull and the cat . ” Sard eyed them to see who and what they were : the two drunkards were from a small barque in the bay : the sober boy , to his amazement , was Huskisson , a first - voyager from the _ Pathfinder _ . Huskisson , a _ Pathfinder _ , running the midnight with these two night - owls , within an hour or two of landing , and not ten days from Captain Cary 's death . Sard stiffened and waited . The drunkards bowed low to Sard , laughed , lurched across to the door of the centre house of the Last Sighs , and banged upon it with their fists . They shouted a song as they banged . “ Beautiful Rosey - posey , Ever I think of thee , I love sweet Rosey - posey And sweet Rosey - posey loves me . ” One of them called to the waiter to bring them some vinos ; the other , a short , squat , sub - nosed lad , whose name was Crockums , did not like the waiter . _ Crockums _ : You darned mañana Dago , fetch the vinos , intende , or I 'll smash your papish chops . You want to forget , you ai n't in no Vatican , now , nor yet in any rancheria . Come on , Paggy , and pitch this feller over the bubb - banisters . _ Paggy _ : No ; he 's not a genelum ; never fight with a feller 's not a genelum ; never fight with a genelum 's not ( singing ) “ A captain in the how - d'ye - do brigade .

stated that it is the duty of a good and capable wife to protect her husband for the balance of their life 's journey , so that he would be able to avoid the traps which his enemies set for his feet . Peter , having learned by bitter experience , would never again go chasing after a pretty face , and wake up next morning to find his pockets empty . Peter admitted this too . As this conversation progressed , he realized that the tour of triumph his life had become was a thing entirely of his wife 's creation ; at least , he realized that there would be no use in trying to change his wife 's conviction on the subject . Likewise he meekly accepted her prophecies as to his future conduct ; he would bring home his salary at the end of each week , and his wife would use it , together with her own salary , to improve the appearance and tone of both of them , and to aid them to climb to a higher social position . Peter , following his wife 's careful instructions , has already become more dignified in his speech , more grave in his movements . She tells him that the future of society depends on his knowledge and his skill , and he agrees to this also . He has learned what you can do and what you had better not do ; he will never again cross the dead - line into crime , or take chances with experiments in blackmail . He will try no more free lance work under the evil influence of low creatures like Nell Doolin , but will stand in with the “ machine , ” and bear in mind that honesty is the best policy . So he will steadily progress ; he will meet the big men of the country , and will go to them , not cringing and twisting his hat in his hands , but with quiet self - possession . He will meet the agents of the Attorney - General aspiring to become President , and will furnish them with material for their weekly Red scares . He will meet legislators who want to unseat elected Socialists , and governors who wish to jail the leaders of “ outlaw ” strikes . He will meet magazine writers getting up articles , and popular novelists looking for local Red color . But Peter 's best bid of all will be as a lecturer . He will be able to travel all over the country , making a sensation . Did he know why ? No , Peter answered , he was not sure he did . Well , Gladys could tell him ; it was because he was romantic . Peter did n't know just what this word meant , but it sounded flattering , so he smiled sheepishly , showing his crooked	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Bolshevism-- To His Honor : As I entered the sanctuary , I gazed upward to the stained glass dome , upon which were inscribed four words : Peace . Justice . Truth . Law -- and I felt hopeful . Before me were men who had violated no constitutional right , who had not the slightest criminal tendency , who , were opposed to violence of every kind . The trial proceeded . I looked again at the beautiful stained glass dome , and whispered to myself those majestic - sounding words : “ Peace . Justice . Truth . Law . ” I listened to the prosecutors ; the Law in their hands was a hard , sharp , cruel blade , seeking insistently , relentlessly for a weak spot in the armor of its victims . I listened to their Truth , and it was Falsehood . Their Peace was a cruel and bloody War . Their justice was a net to catch the victims at any cost -- at the cost of all things but the glory of the Prosecutor 's office . I grew sick at heart . I can only ask myself the old , old question : What can we , the people do ? How can we bring Peace , justice , Truth and Law to the world ? Must we go on bended knees and ask our public servants to see that justice is done to the defenceless , rather than this eternal prosecuting of the world 's noblest souls ! You will find these men guilty , and sentence them to be shut behind iron bars -- which should never be for human beings , no matter what their crime , unless you want to make beasts of them . Is that your object , sir ? It would seem so ; and so I say that we must overturn the system that is brutalizing , rather than helping and uplifting mankind . Yours for Peace .. Justice .. Truth .. Law-- Mary Angelica Godd . What were you going to do with such a woman ? Peter could understand the bewilderment of His Honor , and of the district attorney 's office , and of the secret service department of the Traction Trust -- as well as of Mrs. Godd 's husband ! Peter was bewildered himself ; what was the use of his coming out here to get more information , when Mrs. Godd had already committed contempt of court in writing , and had given all the information there was to give to a Federal agent ? She had told this man that she had contributed several thousand dollars to the Peoples ' Council , and that she intended to contribute more . She had put up bail for a whole bunch of Reds and Pacifists , and she intended to put up bail for McCormick and his friends , just as soon as the corrupt capitalist courts	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

She stood watching the wagon go along the path they had come by from the Port , until its roof dipped out of sight over the crest of the hill ; then she went slowly back along the threadlike path among the trees . A white - winged bird flapped across her path ; already fear of the stillness was upon her . When she reached the break in the trees and the clearing was visible , the hut on the brow of the hill had an alien aspect . The air was empty without the sound of Donald 's axe clanging in the distance , or of his voice calling Lassie . She was glad when Davey began to cry fretfully . But she could not sing to him . She tried , and her voice wavered and broke . Every other murmur in the stillness was subdued to listen to it . The day seemed endless . At last night came . She closed and barred the door of the hut at sunset , glancing towards the shelf where Donald had put his gun . The firelight flickered and gleamed on its polished barrel . Kneeling by the hearth she tried to pray . But her thoughts were flying in an incoherent flight like scattered birds . Davey slept peacefully on the bed among the grey ' possum furs she had wrapped round him . She watched him sleeping for awhile , and then undressing noiselessly , lay down beside him .

always a merry time when Pat Glynn put up anywhere for the night . He came trotting into Wirreeford on the day of the early November sales , about two years after Deirdre and the Schoolmaster had left the hills . The township was full of dust , cattle , and dogs ; boys , yelling , drafting and beating beasts from one yard to another , men watching them , drovers , lean , sun - dried , hawk - eyed men , cattle - buyers , cattle - owners and auctioneers . Horses were hanging on loose reins about the sale - yards , or in rows with drooping heads along the hitching posts at the Black Bull and Mrs. Hegarty 's . Two or three heavy family carry - alls were drawn up before the store where the women , with children about them , were shopping , buying lengths of calico , dress stuffs , or groceries and ironmongery , to take home to the hills . Word that Pat Glynn was at Hegarty 's went round like wildfire . So at Mrs. Mary Ann 's it was that all the miscellaneous crowd of the sale - yards foregathered . They danced until the blood boiled under weather - beaten , leathern faces , and the rising sweat left furrows in the dust of the road on them . Matted , lank , sun - bleached hair lay in wet streaky locks on foreheads marked with the line of hats that almost grew on them -- the line beyond which the sunburn never travelled . Men , women , boys and girls of all ages , children , grandfathers and grandmothers , Pat danced them all to a state of breathless exhaustion . As he tucked his fiddle under his chin and raked it with his long bow , his eyes gleamed with mischief and merriment . His arm went backwards and forwards so dexterously , with such agility , that the gay airs he played possessed him as well as everyone who heard them . Old men and women left their benches by the wall and skipped and trundled until the pine floor shook . The only people who were not dancing were a young mother with a baby in her arms and a teamster too drunk to do more than hang by the doorpost . He attempted a few wild and hilarious movements , fell headlong and was dragged feet foremost to the door and thrown out , because he cumbered the floor . The young mother joggled her baby and sang softly in tune to Pat 's music , enfolding the assembled company and Pat himself in her beaming smile . It was incense to Pat 's soul to see everybody within earshot moving . The clatter , rhythmic lift , shuffle and thump of heavily - shod feet was as good to his ears as any of the old airs he played	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The two men watched it jiggle along above the bushes of wild roses , through verdant clumps of fragrant bayberry , and disappear into the woods . Then they sat down to await Jan 's appearance . The twilight was rarely beautiful . In a sky of palest turquoise a crescent moon hung low , its arc of silver poised above the tips of the stunted pines , whose feathery outlines loomed black in the dusk . From out the dimness the note of a vesper sparrow sounded and mingled its sweetness with the faintly breathing ocean . The men on the doorstep smoked silently , each absorbed in his own reveries . How peaceful it was there in the stillness , with the hush of evening descending like a benediction on the darkening earth ! Bob sighed with contentment . His year of hard study was over , and now that his well - earned rest had come he was surprised to discover how tired he was . Already the peace of Wilton was stealing over him , its dreamy atmosphere almost too beautiful to be real . From where he sat he could see the trembling lights of the village jewelling the rim of the bay like a circlet of stars . A man might do worse , he reflected , than remain a few days in this sleepy little town .

But I was quite out of it . I was the youngest there . They had two elevens without me , and I did n't know a soul there , except Dick Penga , and he had had the swot of bringing me and thought me a child , besides . “ There was a Spanish lady , a widow , there with her daughter , who was of my own age .

push that to the wall and then climb to the water . ” “ Yes , I will , ” Hilary said : “ only I must wait for a moment , for this sickness to pass . ” He stayed there huddled against the wall , with his eyes shut , for two or three minutes . He looked liker a dead man than a living . At last he moved forward from the wall and slowly crawled to the table . The table was liker a large old English stool than a table . When he reached it , he drooped forward over it as though he would never have the strength to rise . “ Take your time , ” Sard said . “ Do not try to lift that stool , but push it before you while you lean on it . So . That is you . Not too big a push at a time : take it quietly . ” “ Oh , I do feel so sick ! ” Hilary said . “ No wonder . You 've had a bat on the head , ” Sard said . “ You are a marvel to be moving at all , but go handsomely ; there 's always time ; always lots of time ; no rushing . Now wait ; rest ; gather your strength again . ” He waited , leaning on the stool , while the others watched him . “ You are nearly there , ” Sard said . “ One more little effort and you will be there . I think your brother 's a hero , Miss Kingsborough , to be doing this , in his state . ” “ You are wonderful , Hilary , ” she said . “ Now forward again . ” The sick man thrust the stool before him almost to the wall . “ Stop there , ” Sard said . “ Do not push it further under the shelf . Now you are almost there : all that you have to do now is to heave yourself up and reach the jug . Steady yourself against the wall . ” Hilary with an effort hove himself to a kneeling posture on the stool . When there , he found that he had pushed it too far underneath the shelf . He could not see the jug , but saw instead that he would have to lean somewhat backward , clutching to the shelf with one hand while he groped for the jug with the other . The thought of doing this unnerved him , he made no attempt for a minute . “ It is just directly over your head , ” Margarita told him . “ Yes , I know where it is , ” he answered , “ only getting it is the problem . However , it is water . ” “ It is lovely water , which	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
old man back in a voice choked with agitation . Moche was already half - way down the stairs , but he turned back and re - entered the room : “ What do you want with me , sir ? ” he asked , eyeing the Englishman haughtily up and down . “ Moche , come here , ” said the latter , and hurriedly catching the other by the sleeve of his coat , he led him into an adjoining room , his library and study . In feverish haste he pulled open a drawer and took out a cheque - book . Dipping a pen in the ink , he paused before writing to ask : “ Monsieur Moche , how much ? ” “ Beg pardon ! ” said the old brigand . Ascott , mastering his nerves , repeated once more : “ I ask you , how much do you want ? this is a cheque I have here , which I am ready to sign in your favour ; fix the amount yourself , and let us have done with this nonsense . ” A gleam of cupidity flashed in the usurer 's eyes , but that astute personage did not yield to the temptation . It was not in that fashion he hoped to bleed the Englishman ; his project was more pretentious , his plan more complicated than that . The old man feigned the greatest indignation : “ It is shameful , sir ; you insult me ! After your villainous treatment of my niece , you offer me money . Sir , you mistake my character altogether ! No , sir , I do not take that bait , the affair must follow its course ! ” Ascott turned livid . “ Moche , ” he supplicated , “ we are friends ... ” “ We _ were _ friends , sir . ” “ Moche ! ... Monsieur Moche ! I can not have a scandal ! ” “ Nini Guinon , my niece , sir , is dishonoured . ” “ But , Moche , how can this be arranged ? ” “ There is but one way , sir , to right the wrong done , religion and society offer you the means . ” Ascott hesitated a moment , then he replied with a shudder . “ Marriage , you mean ? ” he cried ; “ you would have me marry Nini Guinon ... you forget that I am a great nobleman ! ” Moche corrected : “ Lord Ascott , yes ; but that 's not you , that is your father . ” “ I am his son ... ” “ His younger son , sir , which is by no means the same thing . There is nothing should hinder your marrying an honest girl whom you have led astray from the paths of duty . ” Ascott was obviously wavering	, ” he cried , “ sir , sir , sir , ” he paused , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ , sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , ” he said , “ sir , sir , sir , , ” he said , “ , ” he said , “ , ” and he , ” and he , “ ” ” he said , “ ” and he , ” and he , “ ” he , ” and he 
"fishermen had set forth with their buckets and their clam forks , and it was now a full three hours since the motor - boat that carried them had disappeared around the point of sand jutting into the sparkling waters of the bay . Bob and Willie , secreted in the workshop , had breathlessly watched the _ Sea Gull _ thread her way through the channel and make the curving shelter of the dunes , and ever since the old inventor had sat alert on an overturned nail keg , his binoculars in one hand and his great silver watch in the other , counting the moments until the little craft should return from its momentous cruise .

should be sharp with her , lad , ” he said at last . “ Tell her there be other lasses you could love , and she 'll come round in no time . ” Hal nodded . “ I had thought as much myself , ” he said . “ Depend on it , I 'm right , ” said Joe , shaking his head sagely , and reshouldering the basket , and they continued thoughtfully up the dusty road . On turning into the Ship yard they saw the usual company seated on benches before the kitchen door , drinking beer and rum , each man to his fancy . Old Gilbot 's chair had been moved out into the porch , and he sat in it drunk and happy , singing to his heart 's content . The two mates were greeted cheerily ; Joe sat down and called for rum , but Hal , seeing Blueneck and one or two others of the _ Anny 's _ crew among the company , walked into the kitchen , put his cap and coat by , and looked about for Anny . She was not in the kitchen or the scullery , so presently he wandered out into the garden where the evening shadows lay deep over the plants and shrubs . He sat down on an upturned barrel , his elbows resting on his knees and his chin on his hands . Hardly had he been there a moment when there was a rustling in the shrubbery at the end of the garden and Anny , her plaits flying out behind her , sped up the path toward him . She did not notice him , and would have passed had not he put out an arm to stay her . At his touch the girl gave a little terrified scream and started back like a frightened animal . When she saw who it was , however , she gave a little sigh of relief and a smile crept into her face , while her heart beat faster . Hal was going to make friends with her at last , she thought , and as she smiled up at him she felt that here was the solution of her difficulties . Hal on his side felt a glow of pleasure at her obvious friendliness and a warm impulse to take her in his arms . However , he remembered Joe 's advice and the smile died on his lips as he said sharply : “ Where have you been , Ann Farran ? And why come you in so quickly by the back way ? ” The eager , happy light died out of the girl 's eyes in a moment , and a flush of anger spread over her cheeks . “ And what will that matter to you , Master Hal Grame ? ” she said , pertly tossing her head .
